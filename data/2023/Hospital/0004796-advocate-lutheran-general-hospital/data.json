    "planned_diversity_expenditures": "Our organization seeks diverse suppliers for new construction projects, renovations, goods and services (where applicable) and some maintenance. In many cases, these suppliers should have either healthcare experience and/or healthcare construction certification. In most cases, the suppliers will work as subs on projects. We are a signatory of the Health Anchor Network which focuses on increasing the use of diverse suppliers. We are also members of Chicago United and active in the \"Five Forward\" program. Three of the suppliers we mentor (The Bowa Group Inc., Enviroplus, Inc, and Ujaama) we actively seek to both partner them with major contractors and on direct projects, to gain experience to take on larger, prime projects. We have also recommended these suppliers to other health systems. Advocate Aurora Health actively seeks out design & construction suppliers, that are diverse, across both states we operate in. It is an important part of our mission -To help people live well. By extending our business to diverse vendors, we build healthy and strong communities, economically.",
    "plan_for_diversity_recruitment": "We have a number of strategies to continue to keep this top-of-mind with our core vendors and our construction leaders. They are as follows:\n\n1. Minority and woman-owned (M/WBE) firm participation is included in every construction project that is put out for a bid\n2. Advocate Health's goals and expectations are included in EVERY request for proposal (RFP) documents so that bidders are clear about our expectations\n3. We make presentations for all AAH construction vendors every year. It is an expectation to attend. Senior leaders, as part of these presentations, present segments about our diversity and inclusion (D&I) expectations and goals \n4. We ask for and expect reports quarterly from our major suppliers to insure goals are being met\n5. We make presentations to external groups on our supplier diversity objectives, goals, strategies and measures (OGSM) during the year. African American Contractors Assn., and Hispanic American Construction Industry Association are two groups we make presentations to.\n6. Advocate Health has an experienced,  full-time system leader for this work, who works with senior construction leaders closely\n7. In meetings with general contractors on projects, a discussion about and review of spending occurs at least quarterly\n8. Construction Directors for Advocate Aurora Health have discussions about results on their projects in the 1:1 reviews\n with the System VP-Design & Construction quarterly\n9. We exhibit and present at tradeshows and share current organizational needs",
    "challenges_to_diversity_recruitment": "The challenges remain with needing more preparation to get suppliers prepared for larger and more difficult projects, especially a specialized area like healthcare. We continue to have difficulty in diverse utilization in our projects in more rural parts of the state. More development and utilization of diverse construction and design firms by other health systems, along with our efforts, will help to build a more robust group of capable suppliers for Illinois.",
    "hsfrb_assistance": "It would help to continue to require a certain percent of diverse vendors be used during larger construction builds. Encourage vendors that qualify to become certified through one of the recognized third-party certifying bodies to make their business more visible. Healthcare construction may require or constitute a different level of risk and/or additional training and awareness that other industries may require. Healthcare construction courses and entry level programs may also be marketed to open doors to new opportunities. For assistance, hiring a subject matter expert to be an assist would also move the effort forward. Help fund organizations to help speed up the development process of diverse vendors or support programs that promote supplier development or mentorship programs.",

    "point_of_contact": "Contractors should understand and learn who Advocate Health's major design firms and contractors are. Those contractors also have informationals, training, and partner with our organization to offer healthcare construction exposure. Networking with multiple groups helps. I would also encourage potential vendors to become listed with those prime contractors, too.\n\nStacy Crouther, MPH, CPH \nDirector Supplier Business Diversity & Inclusion \nstacy.crouther@aah.org",
    "enrollment_process": "In the preliminary stage vendors can register via our SupplierGATEWAY link https://advocatehealth.suppliergateway.com/\n\nThis does not guarantee a procurement opportunity but does provide insight to your business and it's capabilities.\n\nContractors should understand and learn who Advocate Health's major design firms and contractors are. Those contractors also have informationals, training, and partner with our organization to offer healthcare construction exposure. Networking with multiple groups helps. I would also encourage potential vendors to become listed with those prime contractors, too.",
    "examples_of_successes": "Our on-going work with Chicago United in their Five Forward program, Health Anchor Network Impact Purchasing Commitment, and match making exchanges continues to be an example of how large companies can get experience with diverse vendors.  Our construction directors look for specific opportunities to help them grow. Our Diversity Partnership Program which provides opportunities for diverse construction vendors to gain experience on AAH projects and serves as a pathway to become a preferred general contractor signed on to AAH master agreements.\n \nAdvocate Aurora Health is a founding member of The Democracy Collaborative now known as the Healthcare Anchor Network (HAN), a national organization of 70 health systems. We are able to network and learn from other health systems.\n\nWe participate in the Woman's Business Development Council trade fair  and the national supplier development council's match making event annually.",

    "Planned Diversity Expenditures": "Our organization seeks diverse suppliers for new construction projects, renovations, goods and services (where applicable) and some maintenance. In many cases, these suppliers should have either healthcare experience and/or healthcare construction certification. In most cases, the suppliers will work as subs on projects. We are a signatory of the Health Anchor Network which focuses on increasing the use of diverse suppliers. We are also members of Chicago United and active in the \"Five Forward\" program. Three of the suppliers we mentor (The Bowa Group Inc., Enviroplus, Inc, and Ujaama) we actively seek to both partner them with major contractors and on direct projects, to gain experience to take on larger, prime projects. We have also recommended these suppliers to other health systems. Advocate Aurora Health actively seeks out design & construction suppliers, that are diverse, across both states we operate in. It is an important part of our mission -To help people live well. By extending our business to diverse vendors, we build healthy and strong communities, economically.",
    "Plan for Diversity Recruitment": "We have a number of strategies to continue to keep this top-of-mind with our core vendors and our construction leaders. They are as follows:\n\n1. Minority and woman-owned (M/WBE) firm participation is included in every construction project that is put out for a bid\n2. Advocate Health's goals and expectations are included in EVERY request for proposal (RFP) documents so that bidders are clear about our expectations\n3. We make presentations for all AAH construction vendors every year. It is an expectation to attend. Senior leaders, as part of these presentations, present segments about our diversity and inclusion (D&I) expectations and goals \n4. We ask for and expect reports quarterly from our major suppliers to insure goals are being met\n5. We make presentations to external groups on our supplier diversity objectives, goals, strategies and measures (OGSM) during the year. African American Contractors Assn., and Hispanic American Construction Industry Association are two groups we make presentations to.\n6. Advocate Health has an experienced,  full-time system leader for this work, who works with senior construction leaders closely\n7. In meetings with general contractors on projects, a discussion about and review of spending occurs at least quarterly\n8. Construction Directors for Advocate Aurora Health have discussions about results on their projects in the 1:1 reviews\n with the System VP-Design & Construction quarterly\n9. We exhibit and present at tradeshows and share current organizational needs",
    "Challenges to Diversity Recruitment": "The challenges remain with needing more preparation to get suppliers prepared for larger and more difficult projects, especially a specialized area like healthcare. We continue to have difficulty in diverse utilization in our projects in more rural parts of the state. More development and utilization of diverse construction and design firms by other health systems, along with our efforts, will help to build a more robust group of capable suppliers for Illinois.",
    "HSFRB Assistance": "It would help to continue to require a certain percent of diverse vendors be used during larger construction builds. Encourage vendors that qualify to become certified through one of the recognized third-party certifying bodies to make their business more visible. Healthcare construction may require or constitute a different level of risk and/or additional training and awareness that other industries may require. Healthcare construction courses and entry level programs may also be marketed to open doors to new opportunities. For assistance, hiring a subject matter expert to be an assist would also move the effort forward. Help fund organizations to help speed up the development process of diverse vendors or support programs that promote supplier development or mentorship programs.",
    "Certifications": "#NAME?",
    "Point of Contact": "Contractors should understand and learn who Advocate Health's major design firms and contractors are. Those contractors also have informationals, training, and partner with our organization to offer healthcare construction exposure. Networking with multiple groups helps. I would also encourage potential vendors to become listed with those prime contractors, too.\n\nStacy Crouther, MPH, CPH \nDirector Supplier Business Diversity & Inclusion \nstacy.crouther@aah.org",
    "Enrollment Process": "In the preliminary stage vendors can register via our SupplierGATEWAY link https://advocatehealth.suppliergateway.com/\n\nThis does not guarantee a procurement opportunity but does provide insight to your business and it's capabilities.\n\nContractors should understand and learn who Advocate Health's major design firms and contractors are. Those contractors also have informationals, training, and partner with our organization to offer healthcare construction exposure. Networking with multiple groups helps. I would also encourage potential vendors to become listed with those prime contractors, too.",
    "Examples of Successes": "Our on-going work with Chicago United in their Five Forward program, Health Anchor Network Impact Purchasing Commitment, and match making exchanges continues to be an example of how large companies can get experience with diverse vendors.  Our construction directors look for specific opportunities to help them grow. Our Diversity Partnership Program which provides opportunities for diverse construction vendors to gain experience on AAH projects and serves as a pathway to become a preferred general contractor signed on to AAH master agreements.\n \nAdvocate Aurora Health is a founding member of The Democracy Collaborative now known as the Healthcare Anchor Network (HAN), a national organization of 70 health systems. We are able to network and learn from other health systems.\n\nWe participate in the Woman's Business Development Council trade fair  and the national supplier development council's match making event annually.",
