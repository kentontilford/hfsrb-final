    "covid": "Covid-19 protocols have now been eased at our facility, but we do continue to keep masks readily available for any patient that comes in with any type of respiratory symptom...or for those who just merely want the added protection, for themselves.  We are no longer staffing or conducting any type of wellness check upon entry, nor are we maintaining any type of visitor restriction to those patients in our Acute Care wing.  The following excerpt is actually the response that we submitted in our last annual survey...but it does reiterate the struggles that we were facing, while in the midst of the pandemic crisis.  \n\n\n\n\n\"We have expended a tremendous amount of resources and manpower as part of the pandemic response efforts. For one year of COVID response efforts through March 2021, we estimated that we have spent at least $1 million in staff resources and expenses associated with response efforts. We received over $4 Million in CARES Act Stimulus funding. We did apply for and receive $2.4 million in SBA PPP loans that we anticipate being forgiven. However, guidance keeps changing and the SBA is backlogged on processing and auditing forgiveness applications. As such, there is still so much uncertainty and limitations on utilization of the COVID funding, that we are uncertain how much of the funds we will even be able to keep. \n\nWe have had our incident command activated for over a year now since mid-March 2020. We were holding daily incident command meetings, then reduced that down to 3 days per week and we are currently now at 2 days per week. Staffing the temp check stations has been challenging. At the onset of the pandemic, we used staff temporarily displaced when their department services were shut down. However, once services resumed, it got more difficult to staff the temp check stations and in many cases, it has caused overtime. We are still staffing temp check stations for patients/visitors, incurring additional staffing costs associated with that (approximately $18,000 per month). Our employee entrances at first were staffed with individuals but we eventually switched to automated temp check stations that use facial recognition to read temps that employees then manually log on paper since we don’t electronically archive any data captured on the tablets. It really doesn’t seem logical to continue the temperature taking, since many COVID symptoms have not even included high temperature. We have not heard any IDPH or CDC guidance permitting the discontinuation of the temp check station requirements, which is only adding to the staff shortages and extra costs that could be avoided without an increased risk for exposure.\n\nWe have been able to maintain adequate levels of PPE and sanitation cleaners for staff utilization. We’ve just experienced inflationary costs and delivery delays. We have had some staff complain about having to work outside to collect COVID testing swabs in the ER entrance drive-up when it was cold or raining. We had delayed delivery of rain coats that were ordered for staff to utilize, that eventually did arrive. We also changed up the process to address their concerns regarding testing during inclement weather. There were some complaints regarding pressure sores due to extended use of N95 masks while working on the COVID isolation unit. We purchased CAPR hoods for use to address these concerns. Some staff have complained that we didn’t pay COVID hazard pay or pay for picking up extra shifts. However, we already had policies in place to pay time and half for overtime and when staff were called in to cover shifts. We didn’t have to designate a COVID unit on our inpatient floor until around January and we saw the height of our COVID treatment at the first of 2021 (as opposed to patient spikes in urban areas at that the start of the pandemic). We didn’t give hazard pay for working those units because risk of COVID exposure was not limited to just nursing. Reception, housekeeping, ancillary staff, etc. were all at risk. Therefore, paying hazard pay only for specific staff members would not have been equitable.\n\nDealing with the COVID pandemic has definitely taken a toll on our staff and they are feeling stressed. In rural hospitals, we treated fewer COVID patients than urban areas; however, we didn’t have excess manpower to adequately deal with all the added responsibilities of response efforts, including organizing, communication, developing new policies/processes, tracking new funding and expenses, staffing testing hotlines and specimen collections, administering vaccines, staffing temp stations, etc. This has meant overtime by a lot of staff that has continued for over a year now. It is also hard to find and keep workers because so many prefer to take the unemployment benefits when it is hard enough to find qualified individuals in rural areas. Every employee was impacted in some way or another by the pandemic. We therefore opted to treat all employees equally and did appreciation events routinely throughout the COVID response period. We had cookouts, used COVID grant funds for hospital logo appreciation items like coolers (Keeping Cool Under COVID), gift cards to local businesses (since they were hit hard by COVID and we had some staff with reduced hours during shutdown, the extra money assistance would help show appreciation and compensate for lost time and also those that worked “extra”), logo jackets (since we had to cancel our annual appreciation party). We also did an across-the-board market adjustment January 1, 2021. We couldn’t claim that as COVID funds. However, we didn’t have to give a market adjustment to all employees, just those positions that had to move because of the minimum wage increases. We just figured that helped address any wage compression issues as well as showed our appreciation to all staff for their COVID efforts. We’ve talked about giving COVID bonuses now since it’s surpassed a year that we’ve been dealing with this. However, we are concerned whether HHS will change the guidelines and disqualify a bonus paid out this late in the pandemic.\n\nWe did have to reduce a limited amount of work schedules between mid-March through around May 2020 when we could resume services that had to be discontinued during the shutdown. Some staff were relocated to other job functions like housekeeping and temp check stations. Other staff did begin working remotely, if permissible for their job function. Some staff continue to work remotely, if we cannot accommodate social distancing within their on-site workspace. Those with compromised immune systems were permitted to take time off from work while retaining their benefits. All employees were given up to 80 hours of COVID benefit time eligible for use, per defined qualifying factors and could utilize other available benefit time during these periods of time off.\n\nRevenues have been definitely impacted, but we’ve also added new services like aquatic therapy and expanded upon services like adding a full-time general surgeon in October 2020 which have increased revenues in certain areas. Because of the limitations placed on calculating lost revenues for retaining the COVID Stimulus funds, it will make it difficult to carve out these new/expanded services in order to have an accurate impact of what the pandemic did to our operations. As such, that means less COVID funds that we will be able to retain.\n\nPatients have also struggled, given that we’ve had to restrict visitors. Many patients require that family interaction, as well as assistance with understanding their healthcare issues and making decisions. While we did accommodate those situations as permitted within the restrictions, dealing with end-of-life care under such restricted visitation was extremely difficult. Family should have been able to see their loved ones in their final days and the COVID pandemic restrictions prevented that. This will undoubtedly leave lasting scars on many who had to deal with loss, during this time period.\"",

    "Covid": "Covid-19 protocols have now been eased at our facility, but we do continue to keep masks readily available for any patient that comes in with any type of respiratory symptom...or for those who just merely want the added protection, for themselves.  We are no longer staffing or conducting any type of wellness check upon entry, nor are we maintaining any type of visitor restriction to those patients in our Acute Care wing.  The following excerpt is actually the response that we submitted in our last annual survey...but it does reiterate the struggles that we were facing, while in the midst of the pandemic crisis.  \n\n\n\n\n\"We have expended a tremendous amount of resources and manpower as part of the pandemic response efforts. For one year of COVID response efforts through March 2021, we estimated that we have spent at least $1 million in staff resources and expenses associated with response efforts. We received over $4 Million in CARES Act Stimulus funding. We did apply for and receive $2.4 million in SBA PPP loans that we anticipate being forgiven. However, guidance keeps changing and the SBA is backlogged on processing and auditing forgiveness applications. As such, there is still so much uncertainty and limitations on utilization of the COVID funding, that we are uncertain how much of the funds we will even be able to keep. \n\nWe have had our incident command activated for over a year now since mid-March 2020. We were holding daily incident command meetings, then reduced that down to 3 days per week and we are currently now at 2 days per week. Staffing the temp check stations has been challenging. At the onset of the pandemic, we used staff temporarily displaced when their department services were shut down. However, once services resumed, it got more difficult to staff the temp check stations and in many cases, it has caused overtime. We are still staffing temp check stations for patients/visitors, incurring additional staffing costs associated with that (approximately $18,000 per month). Our employee entrances at first were staffed with individuals but we eventually switched to automated temp check stations that use facial recognition to read temps that employees then manually log on paper since we don’t electronically archive any data captured on the tablets. It really doesn’t seem logical to continue the temperature taking, since many COVID symptoms have not even included high temperature. We have not heard any IDPH or CDC guidance permitting the discontinuation of the temp check station requirements, which is only adding to the staff shortages and extra costs that could be avoided without an increased risk for exposure.\n\nWe have been able to maintain adequate levels of PPE and sanitation cleaners for staff utilization. We’ve just experienced inflationary costs and delivery delays. We have had some staff complain about having to work outside to collect COVID testing swabs in the ER entrance drive-up when it was cold or raining. We had delayed delivery of rain coats that were ordered for staff to utilize, that eventually did arrive. We also changed up the process to address their concerns regarding testing during inclement weather. There were some complaints regarding pressure sores due to extended use of N95 masks while working on the COVID isolation unit. We purchased CAPR hoods for use to address these concerns. Some staff have complained that we didn’t pay COVID hazard pay or pay for picking up extra shifts. However, we already had policies in place to pay time and half for overtime and when staff were called in to cover shifts. We didn’t have to designate a COVID unit on our inpatient floor until around January and we saw the height of our COVID treatment at the first of 2021 (as opposed to patient spikes in urban areas at that the start of the pandemic). We didn’t give hazard pay for working those units because risk of COVID exposure was not limited to just nursing. Reception, housekeeping, ancillary staff, etc. were all at risk. Therefore, paying hazard pay only for specific staff members would not have been equitable.\n\nDealing with the COVID pandemic has definitely taken a toll on our staff and they are feeling stressed. In rural hospitals, we treated fewer COVID patients than urban areas; however, we didn’t have excess manpower to adequately deal with all the added responsibilities of response efforts, including organizing, communication, developing new policies/processes, tracking new funding and expenses, staffing testing hotlines and specimen collections, administering vaccines, staffing temp stations, etc. This has meant overtime by a lot of staff that has continued for over a year now. It is also hard to find and keep workers because so many prefer to take the unemployment benefits when it is hard enough to find qualified individuals in rural areas. Every employee was impacted in some way or another by the pandemic. We therefore opted to treat all employees equally and did appreciation events routinely throughout the COVID response period. We had cookouts, used COVID grant funds for hospital logo appreciation items like coolers (Keeping Cool Under COVID), gift cards to local businesses (since they were hit hard by COVID and we had some staff with reduced hours during shutdown, the extra money assistance would help show appreciation and compensate for lost time and also those that worked “extra”), logo jackets (since we had to cancel our annual appreciation party). We also did an across-the-board market adjustment January 1, 2021. We couldn’t claim that as COVID funds. However, we didn’t have to give a market adjustment to all employees, just those positions that had to move because of the minimum wage increases. We just figured that helped address any wage compression issues as well as showed our appreciation to all staff for their COVID efforts. We’ve talked about giving COVID bonuses now since it’s surpassed a year that we’ve been dealing with this. However, we are concerned whether HHS will change the guidelines and disqualify a bonus paid out this late in the pandemic.\n\nWe did have to reduce a limited amount of work schedules between mid-March through around May 2020 when we could resume services that had to be discontinued during the shutdown. Some staff were relocated to other job functions like housekeeping and temp check stations. Other staff did begin working remotely, if permissible for their job function. Some staff continue to work remotely, if we cannot accommodate social distancing within their on-site workspace. Those with compromised immune systems were permitted to take time off from work while retaining their benefits. All employees were given up to 80 hours of COVID benefit time eligible for use, per defined qualifying factors and could utilize other available benefit time during these periods of time off.\n\nRevenues have been definitely impacted, but we’ve also added new services like aquatic therapy and expanded upon services like adding a full-time general surgeon in October 2020 which have increased revenues in certain areas. Because of the limitations placed on calculating lost revenues for retaining the COVID Stimulus funds, it will make it difficult to carve out these new/expanded services in order to have an accurate impact of what the pandemic did to our operations. As such, that means less COVID funds that we will be able to retain.\n\nPatients have also struggled, given that we’ve had to restrict visitors. Many patients require that family interaction, as well as assistance with understanding their healthcare issues and making decisions. While we did accommodate those situations as permitted within the restrictions, dealing with end-of-life care under such restricted visitation was extremely difficult. Family should have been able to see their loved ones in their final days and the COVID pandemic restrictions prevented that. This will undoubtedly leave lasting scars on many who had to deal with loss, during this time period.\"",

Therefore, we are not required to complete a community health needs assessment (CHNA).  However, we did complete one in 2013...and will e-mail a copy to the address given.\n\nOn page five of the survey, we wanted to clarify that the 19,266 \"off-site/off-campus\" visits are actually those incurred at our on-site rural health clinic.  However, due to current EMR limitations...we would not be able to feasibly determine the \"charity care\" breakdowns on them, in order to add them to that subsequent section.\n\n**See e-mailed attachment for details on the FY 2023 Capital Expenditures, survey page 11 of 15**",
