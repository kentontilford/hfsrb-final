Anticipated Outcome - Complete Competitive Bid With M/Wbe Utilization Provided On Bid Day. - Minority And Women Owned Firm Participation Applied To Every Project. These Goals Are Stated IN Specific Request For Proposal Documents So That Potential Bidders Clearly Understand Our Intention To Award Stated Percentages Of The Project To Diverse Firms. - Bidders List Review Prior To Solicitation By Construction Management Firm OR General Contractor To Assure That The Certified Minority And Woman Owned Firms Are Notified And Solicitation For Participation On The Specific Project. - Implementing Compliance Processes Throughout All Phases Of Project To Assure That Minority And Woman Owned Firms Are Actually Participating On The Project And Are Being Paid Consistent With Prompt Pay Provisions IN The Contract.",

A Strategy We Are Implementing Started With An Availability Exercise Wherein We Sought To Identify All Certified Firms IN This Geographic Area Working IN The Area Of Focus.

Consider Making This An Element Of The Individual's Performance Evaluation. *make M/Wbe Utilization Goals Part Of Your Contract With Construction Management Firms And General Contractors. Goal Achievement Contract Language Flows Down To The Agreements Of The Subcontractors. *put Prompt Pay Language IN Contracts To Assure The M/Wbe As Well As All Firms Are Paid IN A Timely Manner After The Prime Contractor Receives Payment. Small Firms Cannot Wait 45 To 60 Days For Payment. *look At Your Hospital's Payment Processes. How Long Does It Take To Pay Suppliers, Vendors, Contractors? It May Be A Bit Difficult Initially To Recruit Diverse Firms. There Is A Cost Associated With Bidding Work And Small Firms Often Times Focus Their Efforts On Preparing And Submitting Bidding Bids To Organizations Where They Believe They Have A Fair Chance Of Being Successful. An Organization Without A Track Record Of Utilizing Diverse Firms Will Have To Build Trust. Do Not Simply Send The Solicitation To The Diverse Firm And Then Bemoan The Fact They Did Not Respond. Pick Up The Phone And Call The Firm. Ask Them To Look At The Solicitation And Bid Your Work. Assure Them Of Your Intention To Utilize Diverse Firms And Your Intention To Maintain A Level Playing Field Upon Which They Have A Fair Chance Of Landing Business With Your Hospital. Consider Hosting Some Type Of Activity Where You Introduce The Firms To Decision Makers IN Your Organization. Take Care To Emphasize The Validity Of Your Program Assuring Them That Your Efforts Are Not Merely \"window Dressing\". Take A Hard Look At Your Firm And Employ Those Who Support The Efforts Of The Organization To Utilize Diverse Firms At All Levels Of The Organization.",

    "Plan for Diversity Recruitment": "There Are A Number Of Strategies Used To Inform The Various Stakeholders Of Our Intention To Utilize Certified Minority And Women Owned Firms On Our Projects: - Presentations To The Various Advocacy Groups For The Purpose Of Informing Their Members Of The Upcoming Project, Including Bid Packages, Liming For Bid Solicitations, Specific Project Requirements And M/Wbe Contracting And Workforce Goals As Applicable. Presentations Historically Made To Members Of Black Contractors United, African American Contractors Association, Hispanic American Construction Industry Association, Federation Of Women Contractors, And Other Advocacy OR Contracting Membership Organization Seeking Information On An Upcoming Major Project. - Participation At All Prebid Activities Wherein Project Focused Information Is Provided To Potential Bidders Including Contracting Utilization Goals And Workforce Goals As Applicable. Anticipated Outcome - Complete Competitive Bid With M/Wbe Utilization Provided On Bid Day. - Minority And Women Owned Firm Participation Applied To Every Project. These Goals Are Stated IN Specific Request For Proposal Documents So That Potential Bidders Clearly Understand Our Intention To Award Stated Percentages Of The Project To Diverse Firms. - Bidders List Review Prior To Solicitation By Construction Management Firm OR General Contractor To Assure That The Certified Minority And Woman Owned Firms Are Notified And Solicitation For Participation On The Specific Project. - Implementing Compliance Processes Throughout All Phases Of Project To Assure That Minority And Woman Owned Firms Are Actually Participating On The Project And Are Being Paid Consistent With Prompt Pay Provisions IN The Contract.",
    "Challenges to Diversity Recruitment": "While We Have Managed To Successfully Mitigate Most Challenges Encountered IN The Implementation Of Our Diversity Program We Still Have Challenges Identifying Certified Minority And Women Owned Firms IN Particular Trade Areas Specifically Plumbing And Mechanical (hvac). Firms Do Exist IN These Service Areas But They Are Low IN Number. The Lack Of Availability Compromises Our Ability To Achieve Maximum Participation IN This Functional Area. A Strategy We Are Implementing Started With An Availability Exercise Wherein We Sought To Identify All Certified Firms IN This Geographic Area Working IN The Area Of Focus. We Were Hoping To Identify Emerging And/OR Newly Certified Firms That May Not Be On Our Bidders' List. We Try To Help Emerging Plumbing And Mechanical Firms With Mentor/Protege Agreements With Larger Firms.",
    "HSFRB Assistance": "The Ihfsrb Can Assist IN Our Efforts By Continuing To Encourage Others To Develop And Implement Robust Supplier/Contractor Utilization Programs. By Providing Certified, Diverse Firms With The Opportunity Of A Consistent Flow Of Work That They Have A Real Possibility Of Winning, These Firms Have The Possibility Of Increasing Their Technical Capacity And Financial Depth. These Firms Will Become Organizationally Healthy And Will Be Able To Hire More Workers And Take On Larger And More Complex Jobs. They Will Become Better Business Partners For Us All.",

    "Examples of Successes": "*set Achievable But Realistic Goals *accountability - Key Staff Accountable For Meeting OR Exceeding Goals. Consider Making This An Element Of The Individual's Performance Evaluation. *make M/Wbe Utilization Goals Part Of Your Contract With Construction Management Firms And General Contractors. Goal Achievement Contract Language Flows Down To The Agreements Of The Subcontractors. *put Prompt Pay Language IN Contracts To Assure The M/Wbe As Well As All Firms Are Paid IN A Timely Manner After The Prime Contractor Receives Payment. Small Firms Cannot Wait 45 To 60 Days For Payment. *look At Your Hospital's Payment Processes. How Long Does It Take To Pay Suppliers, Vendors, Contractors? It May Be A Bit Difficult Initially To Recruit Diverse Firms. There Is A Cost Associated With Bidding Work And Small Firms Often Times Focus Their Efforts On Preparing And Submitting Bidding Bids To Organizations Where They Believe They Have A Fair Chance Of Being Successful. An Organization Without A Track Record Of Utilizing Diverse Firms Will Have To Build Trust. Do Not Simply Send The Solicitation To The Diverse Firm And Then Bemoan The Fact They Did Not Respond. Pick Up The Phone And Call The Firm. Ask Them To Look At The Solicitation And Bid Your Work. Assure Them Of Your Intention To Utilize Diverse Firms And Your Intention To Maintain A Level Playing Field Upon Which They Have A Fair Chance Of Landing Business With Your Hospital. Consider Hosting Some Type Of Activity Where You Introduce The Firms To Decision Makers IN Your Organization. Take Care To Emphasize The Validity Of Your Program Assuring Them That Your Efforts Are Not Merely \"window Dressing\". Take A Hard Look At Your Firm And Employ Those Who Support The Efforts Of The Organization To Utilize Diverse Firms At All Levels Of The Organization.",
