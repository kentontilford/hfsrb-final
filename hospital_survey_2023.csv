We offer  counseling and business acumen support to our MBE/WBE firms.  It's exciting to see the Emerging firms increase in numbers, scale and revenue.","The only challenges we typically face is continued growth of our MBE/WBE firms.  Also, soliciting for new firms to add into our database who have relative experience.  Many of our emerging MBE/WBE firms often reach their capacity working on our projects which requires additional support.","The review board can assist by working collaboratively with us to find and develop new firms, help to strengthen relationships with the Trade Unions and seek opportunities for inclusion (projects).  It would also be helpful to assist with and/or establish workforce development initiatives.","We accept national - (NMSDC and WBENC), state and local (Mid-States), (Lambert Airport - City of St. Louis) certifying bodies.","We asked that interested parties reach out to our Senior Diversity Manager

On the inpatient setting, we did see an increase in average Case Mix Index compared to 2022. It is difficult to determine the exact impact of COVID on this metric as patients have been becoming increasingly complex with multiple co-morbidities and reduced quality of life despite improved lifespan. 

Staffing issues continued into 2023 due to COVID illnesses, exposures, and quarantined staff though more accommodating policies and mandates lessened the impact in 2023 when compared to 2022. 

The additional revenue stream afforded by COVID testing continued into 2023 though we saw a 18% reduction in testing when compared to 2022. 

Volumes are recovering, albeit slower than required to mitigate the rising expense pressures faced by hospitals.","David L.

With our margin being so meager as an organization we have to find the win/win solutions where a diverse suppliers can be a lower cost provider and help the community.",Invest in encouraging talent recruitment and development.  Need to get these diverse suppliers on par with their competitors from a depth and sophistication perspective.  Invest funds in the diverse suppliers in our community to lower their operating costs that would improve their costs to us going forward. Or provide a grant to organizations like ours to subsidize the cost increase of diverse suppliers.,"Recognized organizations include:
1. Local or national minority supplier development councils.
2. Woman owned business development centers.
3. Local, State or Federal government agencies.
4. Nationally recognized   chamber of commerce, e.g.",Contact should be made through the Supply Chain Category management team or in response to a bid request,"In working with the Category management team, the vendor/supplier will provide documentation if selected as an approved vendor or they will be recognized in our 3rd party tool.","As an owner, we look to many of the general contractors in the Chicagoland area and discuss those diverse partnerships they have formed.  Many of the general contractors have forged both relationships and programs to help elevate the work product being provided.  Additionally, there are many diverse suppliers who have grown from being material passthrough suppliers to active performers of work – capitalizing on these existing relationships and extending the breadth of scope for those same vendors has been beneficial to all parties.

The efforts are continued, to this day.  

Staffing hours were abruptly reduced and employees furloughed, some positions terminated, organization wide as a result of declining volumes. There became a greater need for cross training as employees were requested to fill in for other areas.  As the Covid cases grew in our community, many of our staff were affected by IDPH recommended quarantine. It then became difficult to fully staff while our volumes were increasing.  The surge of patients and variable staff prompted the issuance of hazard pay to all employees for hours worked.  

Our physician clinics and convenient care were open less hours with one satellite clinic closed for several months.  Many services were ceased for a period of time, including: cardiac and pulmonary rehab, aquatic therapy, pulmonary function tests, and elective surgeries.  Community wellness and annual wellness outreach were postponed.  Most areas saw a reduction in volumes as patients delayed preventative health screens and elective procedures.  

There became a challenge to obtain some supplies as the organization ramped up the usage of PPE.  Many items that were reusable, became replaced with disposable supplies.  Once reliable vendors had difficulty supplying orders in a timely manner and/or increased prices to make up for the challenges they were experiencing in production and distribution.  The pharmacy had to adapt to medication shortages. Eventually, the rise in prices caused an inflationary period in all areas of non-salary expense. 

Several physical changes occurred to our facilities.  The Surgery endo suite was converted to a 5 bed Covid unit with negative air pressure rooms. ICU rooms were made into permanent ISO rooms as well as rooms in ED, PCU, OB and Med/Surg. A drive-through testing site was established in the physician clinic to keep suspected positive patients from entering public areas.  Fewer entrances into the hospital were allowed for visitors and staff in order to centralize symptom and temperature checks.  

The organization began to rely on technology even more.  Equipment and staff training were quickly needed to begin Telehealth visits.  Technology setup began in the new Covid unit and drive through lab site with already limited staff. Video conferencing was utilized for virtual meetings. Skype accounts were set up for patients in our Extended Care facility in order for them to stay in touch with loved ones while visiting was restricted.  

Reduced hours in EVS posed a problem as deep cleans were needed more frequently.  Our laundry service vendor ceased providing service as a precaution to their workers. A new vendor was quickly sought after with a significant increase in price due to the urgency. 

In 2021 and 2022, there became a challenge of filling open positions. The more expensive alternative of agency staffing became heavily relied on. Wage scale adjustments were determined to be necessary in order to stay competitive with other employers in the area and to reduce the compression of the wage table throughout the organization.  Recruitment tools such as a sign on bonus and referral bonus program were implemented as the need for critical positions grew. Wage scale adjustments continued in 2023 while agency staffing was reduced but not eliminated.

While we apply goals and track and monitor M/WBE outcomes in the areas of spend above.
For the purpose of this document, we are providing outcomes for new construction and renovation projects","There are a number of strategies used to inform the various stakeholders of our intention to utilize certified Minority and Women owned firms on our projects:
-Presentations to the various advocacy groups for the purpose of informing their members of the upcoming project, including bid packages, liming for bid solicitations, specific project requirements and M/WBE contracting and workforce goals as applicable.
Presentations historically made to members of Black Contractors United, African American Contractors Association Hispanic American Construction Industry Association, Federation of Women Contractors, and other advocacy or contracting membership organization seeking information on an upcoming major project.

-Participation at all prebid activities where in salient project focused information is provided to potential bidders including
contracting utilization goals and workforce goals as applicable. Anticipated outcome - Complete competitive bid with M/WBE utilization provided on bid day.

-Minority and women owned firm participation applied to every project. These goals are stated in specific request for proposal documents so that potential bidders clearly understand our intention to award stated percentages of the project to diverse firms.

-Bidders list review prior to solicitation by construction management firm or general contractor to assure that the certified minority and woman owned firms are notified and solicitation for participation on the specific project.
-Implementing compliance processes throughout all phases of project to assure that minority and woman owned firms are actually participating on the project and are being paid consistent with prompt pay provisions in the contract.",While we have managed to successfully mitigate most challenges encountered in the implementation of our diversity program we still have challenges identifying certified minority and women owned firms in particular trade areas specifically plumbing and mechanical (HVAC). Firms do exist in these service areas but they are low in number. The lack of availability compromises our ability to achieve maximum participation in this functional area. A strategy we are implementing started with an availability exercise wherein we sought to identify all certified firms in this geographic area working in the area of focus. We were hoping to identify emerging and/or newly certified firms that may not be on our bidders' list. We try to help emerging plumbing and mechanical firms with mentor/protege agreements with larger firms.,"The IHFSRB can assist in our efforts by continuing to encourage others to develop and implement robust supplier/contractor utilization programs. By providing certified, diverse firms with the opportunity of a consistent flow of work that they have a real possibility of winning, these firms have the possibility of increasing their technical capacity and financial depth. These firms will become organizationally healthy and will be able to hire more workers and take on larger and more complex jobs. They will become better business partners for us all.","* City of Chicago

*Accountability - Key staff accountable for meeting or exceeding goals. Consider making this an element of the individual's performance evaluation.
*Make M/WBE utilization goals part of your contract with construction management firms and general contractors. Goal achievement contract language flows down to the agreements of the subtrades.
*Put prompt pay language in contracts to assure the M/WBE as well as all firms are paid in a timely manner after the prime contractor receives payment. Small firms cannot wait 45 to 60 days for payment.
*Look at your hospital's payment processes. How long does it take to pay suppliers, vendors, Contractors? Is there a payment bottleneck in your process that can be eliminated?

It may be a bit difficult initially to recruit diverse firms. There is a cost associated with bidding work and small firms often times focus their efforts on preparing and submitting bidding bids to organizations where they believe they have a fair chance of being successful. An organization without a track record or utilizing diverse firms will have to build trust. Do not simply send the solicitation to the diverse firm and then bemoan the fact they did not respond. Pick up the phone and call the firm. Ask them to look at the solicitation and bid your work. Assure them of your intention to utilize diverse firms and your intention to maintain a level playing field upon which they have a fair chance or landing business with
your hospital. Consider hosting some type of activity where you introduce the firms to decision makers in your organization. Take care to emphasize the validity of your program assuring them that your efforts are not merely ""window dressing"". Take a hard look at your firm and those you employ.",2023

We work with our surrounding communities and seek to help diversity-owned businesses thrive whenever and wherever we can. 
By presenting bidding opportunities to certified diverse businesses and to make a good-faith effort in our procurement activities to utilize minority-owned, women-owned, and disabled-owned businesses (MWDB) to meet its procurement needs. 
All efforts to contract and engage MWDB suppliers will be fair and impartial. No preference will be given to any business group or classification. The goal is to increase MWDB participation where possible in the provision of goods and services.","Once the Hospital has determined the needs of the project, the CON or process of identifying a minority architect will be then next step.  Once the project plans are final an RFP will be available for bidding.  It is the goal of the Hospital to identify female-owned, minority-owned and/or veteran-owned business to contribute to the project from brick and mortar construction to supplies.","Supplier diversity challenges are most noticed in supplies for the Hospital needs i.e. beds, ventilators, critical care supplies and other such supplies.  In the areas of construction if the main construction company is not female-owned, minority-owned, veteran-owned or is a small business we seek to request that they commit to identifying and working with a business in one of the categories if and when possible.","In an effort to compliment our current vendor list, sharing vendors used on other projects; construction, furnishings and supplies alike would be an opportunity to increase our database.","51 percent or more of the stock or equity of the business must be owned by a person or persons of the minority group being measured.
• Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB)
Businesses owned and operated by socially and economically disadvantaged persons may be eligible for SDB self-certification
• Service-disabled Veteran-owned Small Business Concern (SDVOSBC)
U.S. military veterans who acquired a disability as a result of their service may qualify for SDVOSBC status through the Vets First Verification Program.","Sonya Swinnie, Director, Supply Chain Management

Space/COVID Separation: No separation of space was required in 2023

Volumes:  2023 volumes were comparable in some areas and increased in other areas.  We did see increased numbers in areas were new specialists were added. .

Supplies/Equipment:  Supply shortages stablized in most areas with only a few areas of concern which we continue to monitor and respond to.  We work closely with our GPO.

Staffing:  Like most healthcare facilities, throughout 2023 and continuing today, we are faced with staffing shortages in many areas of our facility.  We continue to struggle with shortages across the facility, particularly nursing and nursing.  We have continued to secure temporary agency staffing, however, this comes at a significant cost.  Recruitment also continues to be a challenge at times for a smaller facility to compete with some of the sign-on bonuses and staff retention bonuses that larger organizations are able to offer.  Although we have faced some challenges with staffing, our team always comes together to take care of our patients.

Funding:  No additional pandemic-related funding was received in calendar year 2023.",Pam J. Pfister,Chief Executive Officer,(815) 772-5530,ppfister@mchstaff.com,Cami L.

For our Wellness Center project, we are complying with the terms of the grant require the inclusion of minority owned enterprises as well as women owned enterprises to participate as vendors. We have contracted with the below vendors to comply with these requirements:

HVAC: GT Mechanical/ Dynamic 
Fire Protection: Pro-fast
Electrical: The Moore Group
Roofing: Kedmont
Painting: MJB Decorating
Doors & Hardware: AndersonLock
Electrical – Low Voltage: CVADA
Metal Panels/Shades: Tueshall

Flooring: American Floor Company
Masonry: All Masonry
Drywall: All Masonry
Epoxy Floorings: CCI Flooring
Grand Level Landscaping: Great Lakes Landscaping","To effectively promote supplier and contractor diversity in upcoming planned capital expenditures, HPH will implement a multifaceted approach that involves communication, outreach, and collaboration. 
Internal Communication:
Internal communication within the hospital is crucial to ensure that all relevant departments and stakeholders are aware of the initiative to promote supplier and contractor diversity. Efforts to increase organizational awareness of this initiative will involve memos, emails, presentations to key personnel, including HPH’s Materials Management team, departmental leadership, and the HPH executive team.
External Outreach:
HPH’s Material Management team will keep track of known diverse suppliers and contractors to inform them of upcoming capital expenditure opportunities. This will involve maintaining an on-going vendor database that allows us to search for vendors that are MWV owned. Given that our Materials Management team serves as the gatekeeper for capital expenditures, this team will always review potential MWE vendors in HPH’s vendor database to determine if there are any MWV vendors that may potentially meet the needs of the requested capital expenditure. 
HPH will begin to put processes in place to utilize existing networks and partnerships with diversity organizations, minority business enterprises (MBEs), and women business enterprises (WBEs) to reach out to a broader pool of potential suppliers and contractors. This also entails attending industry events, conferences, and networking opportunities focused on diversity and inclusion to connect with new suppliers and contractors.
Promotion through Various Channels:
HPH will leverage its website and social media channels to publicly announce their commitment to supplier and contractor diversity and highlight upcoming opportunities.
HPH’s Materials Management and Marketing teams will work together to issue press releases and articles in local newspapers and industry publications to raise awareness within the community and among relevant stakeholders. This also entails including information about the initiative in relevant procurement documents, such as bid notices and requests for proposals (RFPs), to ensure that potential suppliers and contractors are aware of HPH’s commitment to diversity.
Training and Resources:
HPH will provide training and resources to its Materials Management staff responsible for the procurement process as well as all operational stakeholders involved in the vendor decision-making process. The goal of the training will be to ensure that they understand the importance of diversity and inclusion and are equipped to evaluate and select diverse suppliers and contractors fairly and objectively.
Measurement and Reporting:
HPH will establish metrics and benchmarks to track progress in promoting supplier and contractor diversity and regularly report on these metrics to internal and external stakeholders.
As HPH improves its processes to increase supplier diversity, we will celebrate successes and share best practices to inspire ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion throughout HPH and the broader community.
Feedback Mechanism:
HPH will establish a feedback mechanism to solicit input from diverse suppliers and contractors on their experiences working with HPH and identify opportunities for improvement.
HPH will use this feedback to continuously refine and enhance the hospital's approach to promoting supplier and contractor diversity.
By implementing such a comprehensive plan, HPH can effectively alert and encourage its internal stakeholders and external enterprises of its efforts to promote supplier and contractor diversity in upcoming planned capital expenditures, fostering a more inclusive and equitable procurement process.",Model just started so we do not have any experience to report at this time.,We have only limited resources to build an infrastructure to support this program.,"At this time, HPH does not hold or recognize any certifications related to the recruitment of diversely-owned vendors/supplies. HPH will work on implementing processes to recognize applicable certifications in this area in CY24.","I. A vendor interested in partnering with Humboldt Park Health (HPH) should contact the Vice President of Professional Services, Diego Lopez, at Dilopez@hph.care. The Vice President of Professional Services will collaborate with the Materials Management team to conduct a value analysis assessment of the vendor and the services offered. A decision to proceed will be made based on organizational need, in alignment with HPH's commitment to increasing its percentage of Minority, Women, and Veteran (MWV) vendors.","To enroll with HPH as a recognized vendor/supplier of diversity ownership, we have established a comprehensive process designed to ensure transparency, fairness, and alignment with our commitment to diversity and inclusion. Here is a step-by-step guide to help vendors/suppliers navigate the enrollment process:
Step 1: Preliminary Requirements
• Business Certification: Vendors/suppliers must first obtain certification as a diverse business. This can be from recognized certifying bodies such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC), Women's Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC), National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC), or similar organizations for veteran-owned, disability-owned businesses.
• Information Gathering: Prepare detailed information about your business, including services or products offered, company history, and any previous work with similar organizations.
Step 2: Registration Process
• Registration: Contact our Vice President of Professional Services, Diego Lopez at Dilopez@HPH.care or HPH’s Materials Management team. The vendor will then be designated as a MWV vendor in HPH’s database. 
• Documentation Submission: HPH’s Material’s Management team will upload the MWV vendor’s required documents, which typically include a diversity certification, business license, insurance information, and any other relevant certifications or qualifications that highlight the vendors credibility. 
Step 3: Assessment and Verification
• Initial Review: Our Materials Management team will review the vendors submission to ensure completeness and compliance with our requirements.
• Verification: HPH may reach out to the vendor for additional information or clarification. In some cases, further verification of the vendors diversity certification and business credentials may be necessary.
Step 4: Approval and Onboarding
• Approval Notification: Once the vendors application and diversity status are verified, they will receive a notification regarding approval and inclusion in our list of diverse vendors/suppliers.
• Contract: Our Materials Management team and the respective operational leader utilizing the vendors services will assist with guiding the vendor through the contracting and onboarding process, which may include training and introduction to key personnel. 
Step 5: Continuous Engagement
• Business Opportunities: As a recognized vendor/supplier of diversity ownership, they will receive notifications about relevant business opportunities and Requests for Proposals (RFPs).
• Performance Evaluation: We are committed to building strong, mutually beneficial relationships with our diverse vendors/suppliers. Regular performance evaluations and feedback sessions will be conducted to ensure ongoing satisfaction and to identify areas for growth and development.
Support and Resources:
HPH is dedicated to supporting diverse vendors/suppliers throughout their journey with us. Should they need assistance during the verification or contracting process, HPH’s Materials Management team is available to provide guidance and resources.
HPH is committed to fostering successful MWV partnerships that contributes to our mutual growth and the broader goals of diversity and inclusion in the business community.",Not at this time,2023

For purposes of this survey, Medicare numbers include Medicare Advantage
2. For purposes of this survey, Medicaid numbers include MCOs
3. Instructions notate that a series of laboratory tests performed on a patient in one visit is
considered to be a single laboratory study. We do not have a good way to currently track this in our
EHR system. Our figures on this survey are reflective of total lab tests performed, as we have
completed this survey in the past.
4. Minor estimation in some areas has been done in order to complete the survey.
5.  Due to the limitations of our EHR system, you will notice negative revenue in one OP bucket and one IP bucket.  This is most likely due to ""transfers"" in the system, but the data available is not easily broken out (ie - transfer from Medicare to Self-Pay after Medicare).
6.  For NET Revenue, we are taking contractual adjustments, bad debt, and other revenue deductions into account.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023

Located in the west and south west sides of Chicago, Sinai serves the most vulnerable populations in very diverse communities.  These communities, largely made up of low-income households and people of color, are disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.  

A majority of the zip codes in the system’s primary service area have over 15,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19. In fact zip code 60629, where Holy Cross Hospital is located, continues to have the highest number of confirmed cases to date in Illinois.  This has had and continues to have significant impact on Mount Sinai Hospital, Holy Cross Hospital, and Schwab Rehabilitation Hospital, all parts of Sinai Chicago.
COVID-19 and each subsequent surge of the pandemic have had several implication on the health system. This continues to impact many areas of Sinai Chicago’s operations including the following: 1) emergency department volumes, 2) inpatient admissions, 3) ambulatory and ancillary volume, 4) financial health, as well as 5) staffing and 6) through put.

Across the health system, patient volumes have declined significantly due to the pandemic. This was seen immediately after the citywide shut down with ED visits dropping 30% from March 2020 to April 2020. In 2021, ED visits have rebounded to only 85% of pre-pandemic volume (2019).
Given that a majority of Sinai Chicago’s patients come through the ED, this led to a negative impact on inpatient admissions as well, declining nearly 20% from March 2020 to April 2020. Inpatient admissions in 2021 continue to be down 6% when compared to pre-pandemic volumes in 2019. 

One of the greatest impacts of COVID-19 continues to be seen in the staffing shortage leading to a negative impact on both financial health and throughput.  The shortage of both nursing and key ancillary staff has caused the system to bleed an additional and unbudgetted $3-5 million dollars a month in premium labor expenses.  In order to manage the staffing challenges, both ambulatory and ancillary services saw substantial declines in volumes due to reallocating staffing resources to more critical inpatient units, especially during the second COVID surge.

Despite these challenges, Sinai Chicago continues to make great efforts to serve the community when and where they need it most.

While we were thankful for the lessons learned and strength that prevailed during this time, we continue to see some of the same struggles and some new ones coming forward. Rural hospitals are markedly challenged as COVID not only promoted but enforced remote working environments. This new climate makes it particularly difficult for organizations in which human resources were already scarce. Not only nursing positions, but entry level positions are increasingly harder to fill, given the vast amount of remote working opportunities available. We have become very creative not only how we recruit colleagues but also shifted our perspective on retaining. Efforts are highly focused on colleague development and growth. Due to inflation and the overall shift in the market, we have seen large salary swings through travel agencies, bonuses, base pay, and more. This in conjunction with supply costs has led to a spike in expenses causing organizations to look at their resources differently and become better stewards to maintain stability for the future. While resources continue to remain a top priority for rural hospitals, we also saw colleague safety rise to the top. Throughout COVID there was much concern for healthcare workers’ exposure and subsequent risk; however, while we see a steady decline in COVID numbers, healthcare remains amongst the top in dangerous careers due to the increase in workplace violence. As a shift in mental health diagnosis and treatment facilities continue to see an inverse relationship, hospitals are seeing progressively more violence coming through their doors. Programs to help keep staff safe during these times are not only a priority but necessary. Signs can be seen throughout our hospitals, establishing a zero-tolerance environment for violence. Staff is trained how to de-escalate situations and keep themselves safe. Security is heightened and metal detectors are now present in emergency rooms. While Culture of Safety continues to be a top priority, that culture has shifted, and we are shifting with it to keep our patients and staff as safe as possible. While COVID-19 may no longer be a hot topic amongst the public, healthcare facilities across the globe will continue to see its effects for many years to come.",Chad Markham,President and CEO,217-774-3961 ext 2510,Chad.Markham@hshs.org,Becca Niebrugge,Director of Finance,217-347-1299,Rebecca.Niebrugge@hshs.org,Becca Niebrugge,Becca Niebrugge,4/12/2024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023

We experienced some lingering staffing issues due to employees leaving the healthcare field during the pandemic.  

Many of the societal challenges from 2020 started to decline in 2023. Sparta Community Hospital continued to maintain an active Incident Command Process throughout the pandemic, although the activities of the team have diminished due to a significant decrease in infections and an increase in mitigation strategies.  

Specific challenges are as follows and are likely similar to most healthcare organizations:

1. The Unknown
Early in the pandemic, information was seemingly changing by the hour. The Incident Command team continued to monitor and address recommendations regarding the pandemic and tried to keep staff and the public updated real-time and explained that operations had and will continue to change quickly as new information and best practice recommendations were released by IDPH and CDC. 

2. PPE
The PPE supply chain was stressed to the max worldwide, but it did improved significantly in 2023.  The Supply chain was replenished and SCH was able to keep the necessary supplies on hand. During periods of limited supplies, Sparta Community Hospital continued to approach the management of PPE supplies in a realistic and responsible manner. The organization's Materials Management department has maintained adequate PPE supplies for staff and continues to evaluate supply chain availability in the case of a surge. The organization continues to follow guidelines for the use of PPE supplies to protect staff and patients.

3. Staffing
Sparta Community Hospital experienced staffing shortages during the pandemic due to infected staff and staff who chose to leave healthcare during the pandemic. There were months where the organization had low number of employees who contracted COVID-19. However, during the Omicron surge, the organization did experience a significant increase in positive COVID-19 cases in staff. In an organization that was already operating at minimal staffing levels, this obviously created stress on the ability to staff some departments, particularly clinical departments such as nursing, laboratory, and diagnostic imaging.  The staffing issues have remedied and we are at full capacity. 

Another staffing challenge was the growth of the nursing agencies, and, therefore, the agencies recruiting registered nurses from Sparta Community Hospital. Fortunately, the organization has experienced a decline in this practice along with a return of agency nurses to acute care facilities.  We no longer have a need for temporary staffing in any of our departments

Further, healthcare fatigue has caused a decrease in individuals with desire to work on the front line of healthcare and has dramatically decreased the number of applicants for open positions in the organization. Sparta Community Hospital partnered with nursing and medical assistant programs to increase the opportunity to recruit potential candidates for such roles.

4. Financial (Volumes)
From spring to late summer of 2020, Sparta Community Hospital volumes were greatly impacted. By August to September of 2020, many departments in the organization had recovered to almost normal volume. Sparta Community Hospital has been able to maintain and strengthen volumes in many service lines impacted by the pandemic. 

5. COVID-19 Testing Supplies
A challenge that has continued since the beginning of the pandemic for Sparta Community Hospital is maintaining an adequate supply of COVID-19 testing supplies for the Laboratory and Emergency departments. 

6. COVID-19 Vaccine
While the COVID-19 vaccine was developed in record time, the distribution, supply, and plan to vaccinate the public has been challenging and frustrating at times. Sparta Community Hospital collaborated with other local hospitals, as well as the County Health Department, to promote and administer the COVID-19 vaccine to staff and the public.

A challenge that Sparta Community Hospital faced during the pandemic, is a low percentage of vaccinated individuals in the service area. 
An additional challenge that Sparta Community Hospital faced was monitoring staff vaccination status and abiding by the mandated testing guidelines concerning staff who are not vaccinated. The organization made all efforts throughout the pandemic to encourage staff to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.  Staff are still encouraged to receive the vaccine, however, SCH does not mandate staff to have the Covid-19 vaccine. 

7. COVID-19 Fatigue
Like many organizations across the nation, Sparta Community Hospital has truly dedicated staff, but COVID-19 did increase fatigue. The organization's staff and providers are ready to move forward and focus on other health issues rather than just the COVID-19 virus.  The medical staff does not agree that Covid-19 should be considered ""just another flu""  and have concerned regarding how society will embrace this.",Joann Emge,Chief Executive Officer,(618) 443-1337,emgej@spartahospital.com,Alisha Otten,Executive Assistant to CEO,(618) 443-1337,medicalstaffoffice@spartahospital.com,Alisha Otten,Executive Assistant to CEO,4/11/2024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023

The associated supply chain interruptions, higher material costs and business closures have impacted processes that were previously more straightforward.","The Board could help by providing a link with organizations that are, or can become, “hospital ready,” and provide that listing to the hospitals and hospital systems on a regular basis. Identifying and regularly sharing lists of diverse suppliers that have a history of work conducted at other anchor hospitals would also be helpful.

In addition, if multiple anchor hospitals are able to identify the need for a particular trade for which a diverse supplier is not available, perhaps training can be done on a larger scale for those companies who would like to develop the capacity to fill the need for for all hospitals that may have a similar need.","We recognize all certifications from third-party agencies, including NMSDC,WBENC, MVBDC, utility companies and all other various certifying agencies.

While we were thankful for the lessons learned and strength that prevailed during this time, we continue to see some of the same struggles and some new ones coming forward. Rural hospitals are markedly challenged as COVID not only promoted but enforced remote working environments. This new climate makes it particularly difficult for organizations in which human resources were already scarce. Not only nursing positions, but entry level positions are increasingly harder to fill, given the vast amount of remote working opportunities available. We have become very creative not only how we recruit colleagues but also shifted our perspective on retaining. Efforts are highly focused on colleague development and growth. Due to inflation and the overall shift in the market, we have seen large salary swings through travel agencies, bonuses, base pay, and more. This in conjunction with supply costs has led to a spike in expenses causing organizations to look at their resources differently and become better stewards to maintain stability for the future. While resources continue to remain a top priority for rural hospitals, we also saw colleague safety rise to the top. Throughout COVID there was much concern for healthcare workers exposure and subsequent risk; however, while we see a steady decline in COVID numbers, healthcare remains amongst the top in dangerous careers due to the increase in workplace violence. As a shift in mental health diagnosis and treatment facilities continue to see an inverse relationship, hospitals are seeing progressively more violence coming through their doors. Programs to help keep staff safe during these times are not only a priority but necessary. Signs can be seen throughout our hospitals, establishing a zero-tolerance environment for violence. Staff is trained how to de-escalate situations and keep themselves safe. Security is heightened and metal detectors are now present in emergency rooms. While Culture of Safety continues to be a top priority, that culture has shifted, and we are shifting with it to keep our patients and staff as safe as possible.

While we were thankful for the lessons learned and strength that prevailed during this time, we continue to see some of the same struggles and some new ones coming forward. Rural hospitals are markedly challenged as COVID not only promoted but enforced remote working environments. This new climate makes it particularly difficult for organizations in which human resources were already scarce. Not only nursing positions, but entry level positions are increasingly harder to fill, given the vast amount of remote working opportunities available. We have become very creative not only how we recruit colleagues but also shifted our perspective on retaining. Efforts are highly focused on colleague development and growth. Due to inflation and the overall shift in the market, we have seen large salary swings through travel agencies, bonuses, base pay, and more.

These challenges have been particularly severe for rural hospitals that were already struggling with shrinking margins, declining volumes, workforce challenges and other barriers to providing care. That impact continued in FY2023 for many rural hospitals. However, because the OSF HealthCare hospitals with 100 beds or less are part of a 16-hospital health care system, during FY23 they continued to realize benefits traditionally have already had support as a critical care hospital. These benefits include supporting operations and services, supplies, leverage of staffing and navigation of the regulatory and financial challenges related to the pandemic. Further, some areas that the OSF critical care hospitals do not independently need to support include centralized services such as revenue cycle, accounts payable and receivable, supply chain, sterile processing, human resources and the contact center for ambulatory needs.

Because these OSF hospitals are connected to a larger system, they are able to scale their delivery system, adjust care models, share clinicians and leverage digital tools developed by the health care system to provide services such as virtual hospitalists and nurse triage, and ICU remote patient monitoring. In addition, some patient populations have access to remote patient monitoring and 24/7 access to a digital care team to help them manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, COPD and asthma. Further, support for pregnant and postpartum women in Illinois on Medicaid is also available.

Many of the general contractors have forged both relationships and programs to help elevate the work product being provided.  Additionally, there are many diverse suppliers who have grown from being material passthrough suppliers to active performers of work – capitalizing on these existing relationships and extending the breadth of scope for those same vendors has been beneficial to all parties.

The pandemic has created an employee market resulting in employees demanding higher salaries because of the rates that agencies and other healthcare organizations are offering. Turnover continues to be elevated because there are many open positions throughout our area. This has resulted in having constant new staff which comes with challenges in caring for the patients and a staff burnout with training new staff. Another area of challenge is the mental health crisis that we are experiencing from the pandemic and the lack of resources to support the patients and families within this arena.,Rolla Sweis,President & Chief Executive Officer,773-753-8631,rsweis@larabida.org,Anthony McWhorter,Executive Director of Finance,773-256-5925,amcwhorter@larabida.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023

While our patients' ability to receive treatment in 2023 improved over 2022, the pandemic continued to impact our patients and hospital operations moderately in 2023. 

In some cases it was necessary to cancel and reschedule surgeries in 2023 because either the patient or a close relative tested positive for covid in the days preceding the scheduled surgery. Those children that we did serve in 2023 are starting to have the experience children deserve and which Shriners provided prior to the pandemic. We were able to increase activities and events which help ease the time spent in the hospital and provide some fun during the patients' recovery. Visitation restrictions were still limited in some cases causing added stress on both the patients and their family members during an already difficult time.

The challenges in operating a hospital during the pandemic continued into 2023, and while some of the additional workload and expenses became a routine part of operations as the pandemic persisted, valuable resources continued to be expended on monitoring employees who tested positive or were exposed, working with patients and families on covid protocols and requirements, and added expenditures incurred for covid testing supplies, PPE and cleaning supplies. The utilization of these resources to address covid meant that resources could not be expended in other areas. 

We were still using Agency/Travelers staffing at increased levels in 2023 but did see it decrease from 2022 totals especially in nursing. Employees needed to take time off when they tested positive or had an exposure, limiting available resources to serve patients and increasing salary costs for paid leave as well as overtime to cover the staffing shortages. Overall we saw a large improvement from 2022 in general operations of the hospital due to Covid.",Craig McGhee,Administrator,773-385-5445,craig.mcghee@shrinenet.org,Mathew Lucas,Director of Fiscal Service,773-385-5416,mathew.lucas@shrinenet.org,Mathew C Lucas,Director of Fiscal Service,4/12/2024,There were 313 telehealth visits in 2023.

1. Local or national minority supplier development councils.
2. Woman owned business development centers.
3. Local, State or Federal government agencies.

Many of the general contractors have forged both relationships and programs to help elevate the work product being provided.

While we apply goals and track and monitor M/WBE outcomes in the areas of spend above for the purpose of this document, we are providing outcomes for new construction and renovation projects.","There are a number of strategies used to inform the various stakeholders of our intention to utilize certified Minority and Women owned firms on our projects:
- Presentations to the various advocacy groups for the purpose of informing their members of the upcoming project, including bid packages, liming for bid solicitations, specific project requirements and M/WBE contracting and workforce goals as applicable. Presentations historically made to members of Black Contractors United, African American Contractors Association Hispanic American Construction Industry Association, Federation of Women Contractors, and other advocacy or contracting membership organization seeking information on an upcoming major project.
- Participation at all prebid activities wherein salient project focused information is provided to potential bidders including contracting utilization goals and workforce goals as applicable. Anticipated outcome - Complete competitive bid with M/WBE utilization provided on bid day.
- Minority and women owned firm participation applied to every project. These goals are stated in specific request for proposal documents so that potential bidders clearly understand our intention to award stated percentages of the project to diverse firms.
- Bidders list review prior to solicitation by construction management firm or general contractor to assure that the certified minority and woman owned firms are notified and solicitation for participation on the specific project.
- Implementing compliance processes throughout all phases of project to assure that minority and woman owned firms are actually participating on the project and are being paid consistent with prompt pay provisions in the contract.",While we have managed to successfully mitigate most challenges encountered in the implementation of our diversity program we still have challenges identifying certified minority and women owned firms in particular trade areas specifically plumbing and mechanical (HVAC). Firms do exist in these service areas but they are low in number. The lack of availability compromises our ability to achieve maximum participation in this functional area. A strategy we are implementing started with an availability exercise wherein we sought to identify all certified firms in this geographic area working in the area of focus. We were hoping to identify emerging and/or newly certified firms that may not be on our bidders' list. We try to help emerging plumbing and mechanical firms with mentor/protege agreements with larger firms.,"The IHFSRB can assist in our efforts by continuing to encourage others to develop and implement robust supplier/contractor utilization programs. By providing certified, diverse firms with the opportunity of a consistent flow of work that they have a real possibility of winning these firms have the possibility of increasing their technical capacity and financial depth. These firms will become organizationally healthy and will be able to hire more workers and take on larger and more complex jobs. They will become better business partners for us all.","* City of Chicago

*Accountability - Key staff accountable for meeting or exceeding goals. Consider making this an element of the individual's performance 
evaluation.
*Make M/WBE utilization goals part of your contract with construction management firms and general contractors. Goal achievement contract 
language flows down to the agreements of the subtrades.
*Put prompt pay language in contracts to assure the M/WBE as well as all firms are paid in a timely manner after the prime contractor receives 
payment. Small firms cannot wait 45 to 60 days for payment.
*Look at your hospital's payment processes. How long does it take to pay suppliers, vendors, Contractors? Is there a payment bottleneck in your 
process that can be eliminated?

It may be a bit difficult initially to recruit diverse firms. There is a cost associated with bidding work and small firms often times focus their efforts

1. Local or national minority supplier development councils.
2. Woman owned business development centers.
3. Local, State or Federal government agencies.
4.

Many of the general contractors have forged both relationships and programs to help elevate the work product being provided.  Additionally, there are many diverse suppliers who have grown from being material passthrough suppliers to active performers of work – capitalizing on these existing relationships and extending the breadth of scope for those same vendors has been beneficial to all parties.

In many cases, these suppliers should have either healthcare experience and/or healthcare construction certification. In most cases, the suppliers will work as subs on projects. We are a signatory of the Health Anchor Network which focuses on increasing the use of diverse suppliers. We are also members of Chicago United and active in the ""Five Forward"" program. Three of the suppliers we mentor (The Bowa Group Inc., Enviroplus, Inc, and Ujaama) we actively seek to both partner them with major contractors and on direct projects, to gain experience to take on larger, prime projects. We have also recommended these suppliers to other health systems. Advocate Aurora Health actively seeks out design & construction suppliers, that are diverse, across both states we operate in. It is an important part of our mission -To help people live well. By extending our business to diverse vendors, we build healthy and strong communities, economically.","We have a number of strategies to continue to keep this top-of-mind with our core vendors and our construction leaders. They are as follows:

1. Minority and woman-owned (M/WBE) firm participation is included in every construction project that is put out for a bid
2. Advocate Health's goals and expectations are included in EVERY request for proposal (RFP) documents so that bidders are clear about our expectations
3. We make presentations for all AAH construction vendors every year. It is an expectation to attend. Senior leaders, as part of these presentations, present segments about our diversity and inclusion (D&I) expectations and goals 
4. We ask for and expect reports quarterly from our major suppliers to insure goals are being met
5. We make presentations to external groups on our supplier diversity objectives, goals, strategies and measures (OGSM) during the year. African American Contractors Assn., and Hispanic American Construction Industry Association are two groups we make presentations to.
6. Advocate Health has an experienced,  full-time system leader for this work, who works with senior construction leaders closely
7. In meetings with general contractors on projects, a discussion about and review of spending occurs at least quarterly
8. Construction Directors for Advocate Aurora Health have discussions about results on their projects in the 1:1 reviews
 with the System VP-Design & Construction quarterly
9. We exhibit and present at tradeshows and share current organizational needs","The challenges remain with needing more preparation to get suppliers prepared for larger and more difficult projects, especially a specialized area like healthcare. We continue to have difficulty in diverse utilization in our projects in more rural parts of the state. More development and utilization of diverse construction and design firms by other health systems, along with our efforts, will help to build a more robust group of capable suppliers for Illinois.","It would help to continue to require a certain percent of diverse vendors be used during larger construction builds. Encourage vendors that qualify to become certified through one of the recognized third-party certifying bodies to make their business more visible. Healthcare construction may require or constitute a different level of risk and/or additional training and awareness that other industries may require. Healthcare construction courses and entry level programs may also be marketed to open doors to new opportunities. For assistance, hiring a subject matter expert to be an assist would also move the effort forward. Help fund organizations to help speed up the development process of diverse vendors or support programs that promote supplier development or mentorship programs.",#NAME?,"Contractors should understand and learn who Advocate Health's major design firms and contractors are. Those contractors also have informationals, training, and partner with our organization to offer healthcare construction exposure. Networking with multiple groups helps.

Our construction directors look for specific opportunities to help them grow. Our Diversity Partnership Program which provides opportunities for diverse construction vendors to gain experience on AAH projects and serves as a pathway to become a preferred general contractor signed on to AAH master agreements.
 
Advocate Aurora Health is a founding member of The Democracy Collaborative now known as the Healthcare Anchor Network (HAN), a national organization of 70 health systems. We are able to network and learn from other health systems.

These challenges have been particularly severe for rural hospitals that were already struggling with shrinking margins, declining volumes, workforce challenges and other barriers to providing care. That impact continued in FY2023 for many rural hospitals. However, because the OSF HealthCare hospitals with 100 beds or less are part of a 16-hospital health care system, during FY23 they continued to realize benefits traditionally have already had support as a critical care hospital. These benefits include supporting operations and services, supplies, leverage of staffing and navigation of the regulatory and financial challenges related to the pandemic. Further, some areas that the OSF critical care hospitals do not independently need to support include centralized services such as revenue cycle, accounts payable and receivable, supply chain, sterile processing, human resources and the contact center for ambulatory needs.

 

Because these OSF hospitals are connected to a larger system, they are able to scale their delivery system, adjust care models, share clinicians and leverage digital tools developed by the health care system to provide services such as virtual hospitalists and nurse triage, and ICU remote patient monitoring. In addition, some patient populations have access to remote patient monitoring and 24/7 access to a digital care team to help them manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, COPD and asthma. Further, support for pregnant and postpartum women in Illinois on Medicaid is also available.

 

One area that these hospitals do continue to struggle with, however, is vaccine hesitancy in their communities. This hesitancy is no longer just for COVID-19, but currently extends to the recent measles outbreak that has been reported in the state.",Derrick Frazier,President,815-842-2828 ext. 3310,Derrick.A.Frazier@osfhealthcare.org,Dona Tharp,Senior Financial Analyst,815-842-4943,Dona.B.Tharp@osfhealthcare.org,Brian Wilkins,Director Entity Finance,4/12/2024,"Rural Heathcare Clinic Volumes and dollars have been added to this IDPH Survey Report.

While we were thankful for the lessons learned and strength that prevailed during this time, we continue to see some of the same struggles and some new ones coming forward. Rural hospitals are markedly challenged as COVID not only promoted but enforced remote working environments. This new climate makes it particularly difficult for organizations in which human resources were already scarce. Not only nursing positions, but entry level positions are increasingly harder to fill, given the vast amount of remote working opportunities available. We have become very creative not only how we recruit colleagues but also shifted our perspective on retaining. Efforts are highly focused on colleague development and growth. Due to inflation and the overall shift in the market, we have seen large salary swings through travel agencies, bonuses, base pay, and more. This in conjunction with supply costs has led to a spike in expenses causing organizations to look at their resources differently and become better stewards to maintain stability for the future. While resources continue to remain a top priority for rural hospitals, we also saw colleague safety rise to the top. Throughout COVID there was much concern for healthcare workers exposure and subsequent risk; however, while we see a steady decline in COVID numbers, healthcare remains amongst the top in dangerous careers due to the increase in workplace violence. As a shift in mental health diagnosis and treatment facilities continue to see an inverse relationship, hospitals are seeing progressively more violence coming through their doors. Programs to help keep staff safe during these times are not only a priority but necessary. Signs can be seen throughout our hospitals, establishing a zero-tolerance environment for violence. Staff is trained how to de-escalate situations and keep themselves safe. Security is heightened and metal detectors are now present in emergency rooms. While Culture of Safety continues to be a top priority, that culture has shifted, and we are shifting with it to keep our patients and staff as safe as possible. While COVID-19 may no longer be a hot topic amongst the public, healthcare facilities across the globe will continue to see its effects for many years to come.",Kelly Sager,President and CEO,618-664-1230,Kelly.Sager@hshs.org,Rebecca Niebrugge,Director of Finance,217-347-1299,Rebecca.Niebrugge@hshs.org,Rebecca Niebrugge,Director of Finance,4/12/2024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023

These challenges have been particularly severe for rural hospitals that were already struggling with shrinking margins, declining volumes, workforce challenges and other barriers to providing care. That impact continued in FY2023 for many rural hospitals. However, because the OSF HealthCare hospitals with 100 beds or less are part of a 16-hospital health care system, during FY23 they continued to realize benefits traditionally have already had support as a critical care hospital. These benefits include supporting operations and services, supplies, leverage of staffing and navigation of the regulatory and financial challenges related to the pandemic. Further, some areas that the OSF critical care hospitals do not independently need to support include centralized services such as revenue cycle, accounts payable and receivable, supply chain, sterile processing, human resources and the contact center for ambulatory needs.

Because these OSF hospitals are connected to a larger system, they are able to scale their delivery system, adjust care models, share clinicians and leverage digital tools developed by the health care system to provide services such as virtual hospitalists and nurse triage, and ICU remote patient monitoring. In addition, some patient populations have access to remote patient monitoring and 24/7 access to a digital care team to help them manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, COPD and asthma. Further, support for pregnant and postpartum women in Illinois on Medicaid is also available.

One area that these hospitals do continue to struggle with, however, is vaccine hesitancy in their communities.

These challenges have been particularly severe for rural hospitals that were already struggling with shrinking margins, declining volumes, workforce challenges and other barriers to providing care. That impact continued in FY2023 for many rural hospitals. However, because the OSF HealthCare hospitals with 100 beds or less are part of a 16-hospital health care system, during FY23 they continued to realize benefits traditionally have already had support as a critical care hospital. These benefits include supporting operations and services, supplies, leverage of staffing and navigation of the regulatory and financial challenges related to the pandemic. Further, some areas that the OSF critical care hospitals do not independently need to support include centralized services such as revenue cycle, accounts payable and receivable, supply chain, sterile processing, human resources and the contact center for ambulatory needs.

 

Because these OSF hospitals are connected to a larger system, they are able to scale their delivery system, adjust care models, share clinicians and leverage digital tools developed by the health care system to provide services such as virtual hospitalists and nurse triage, and ICU remote patient monitoring. In addition, some patient populations have access to remote patient monitoring and 24/7 access to a digital care team to help them manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, COPD and asthma. Further, support for pregnant and postpartum women in Illinois on Medicaid is also available.

 

One area that these hospitals do continue to struggle with, however, is vaccine hesitancy in their communities. This hesitancy is no longer just for COVID-19, but currently extends to the recent measles outbreak that has been reported in the state.",Dawn Trompeter,President OSF SEMC SPMC,815-431-5456,dawn.c.trompeter@osfhealthcare.org,Joshua Wirth,Decision Support,815-431-5479,joshua.a.wirth@osfhealthcare.org,Joshua Wirth,Decision Support,4/12/2024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023

In many cases, these suppliers should have either healthcare experience and/or healthcare construction certification. In most cases, the suppliers will work as subs on projects. We are a signatory of the Health Anchor Network which focuses on increasing the use of diverse suppliers. We are also members of Chicago United and active in the ""Five Forward"" program. Three of the suppliers we mentor (The Bowa Group Inc., Enviroplus, Inc, and Ujaama) we actively seek to both partner them with major contractors and on direct projects, to gain experience to take on larger, prime projects. We have also recommended these suppliers to other health systems. Advocate Aurora Health actively seeks out design & construction suppliers, that are diverse, across both states we operate in. It is an important part of our mission -To help people live well. By extending our business to diverse vendors, we build healthy and strong communities, economically.","We have a number of strategies to continue to keep this top-of-mind with our core vendors and our construction leaders. They are as follows:

1. Minority and woman-owned (M/WBE) firm participation is included in every construction project that is put out for a bid
2. Advocate Health's goals and expectations are included in EVERY request for proposal (RFP) documents so that bidders are clear about our expectations
3. We make presentations for all AAH construction vendors every year. It is an expectation to attend. Senior leaders, as part of these presentations, present segments about our diversity and inclusion (D&I) expectations and goals 
4. We ask for and expect reports quarterly from our major suppliers to insure goals are being met
5. We make presentations to external groups on our supplier diversity objectives, goals, strategies and measures (OGSM) during the year. African American Contractors Assn., and Hispanic American Construction Industry Association are two groups we make presentations to.
6. Advocate Health has an experienced,  full-time system leader for this work, who works with senior construction leaders closely
7. In meetings with general contractors on projects, a discussion about and review of spending occurs at least quarterly
8. Construction Directors for Advocate Aurora Health have discussions about results on their projects in the 1:1 reviews
 with the System VP-Design & Construction quarterly
9. We exhibit and present at tradeshows and share current organizational needs","The challenges remain with needing more preparation to get suppliers prepared for larger and more difficult projects, especially a specialized area like healthcare. We continue to have difficulty in diverse utilization in our projects in more rural parts of the state. More development and utilization of diverse construction and design firms by other health systems, along with our efforts, will help to build a more robust group of capable suppliers for Illinois.","It would help to continue to require a certain percent of diverse vendors be used during larger construction builds. Encourage vendors that qualify to become certified through one of the recognized third-party certifying bodies to make their business more visible. Healthcare construction may require or constitute a different level of risk and/or additional training and awareness that other industries may require. Healthcare construction courses and entry level programs may also be marketed to open doors to new opportunities. For assistance, hiring a subject matter expert to be an assist would also move the effort forward. Help fund organizations to help speed up the development process of diverse vendors or support programs that promote supplier development or mentorship programs.",#NAME?,"Contractors should understand and learn who Advocate Health's major design firms and contractors are. Those contractors also have informationals, training, and partner with our organization to offer healthcare construction exposure. Networking with multiple groups helps. I would also encourage potential vendors to become listed with those prime contractors, too.

With the current state of the Chicgoland market, most qualified labor has been engaged in large projects making them unavailable or unfavorable economically. Capital equipment is generally selected by clinicians with familiarity with the equipment and many large vendors have strong relationships with clinicians.  Most diverse suppliers costs incrementally more than non diverse suppliers. With our margin being so meager as an organization we have to find the win/win solutions where a diverse suppliers can be a lower cost provider and help the community.",Invest in encouraging talent recruitment and development.  Need to get these diverse suppliers on par with their competitors from a depth and sophistication perspective.  Invest funds in the diverse suppliers in our community to lower their operating costs that would improve their costs to us going forward. Or provide a grant to organizations like ours to subsidize the cost increase of diverse suppliers.,"Recognized organizations include:
1. Local or national minority supplier development councils.
2. Woman owned business development centers.
3. Local, State or Federal government agencies.
4. Nationally recognized   chamber of commerce, e.g.",Contact should be made through the Supply Chain Category management team or in response to a bid request,"In working with the Category management team, the vendor/supplier will provide documentation if selected as an approved vendor or they will be recognized in our 3rd party tool.","As an owner, we look to many of the general contractors in the Chicagoland area and discuss those diverse partnerships they have formed.  Many of the general contractors have forged both relationships and programs to help elevate the work product being provided.  Additionally, there are many diverse suppliers who have grown from being material passthrough suppliers to active performers of work – capitalizing on these existing relationships and extending the breadth of scope for those same vendors has been beneficial to all parties.

Many of the general contractors have forged both relationships and programs to help elevate the work product being provided.  Additionally, there are many diverse suppliers who have grown from being material passthrough suppliers to active performers of work – capitalizing on these existing relationships and extending the breadth of scope for those same vendors has been beneficial to all parties.

These challenges have been particularly severe for rural hospitals that were already struggling with shrinking margins, declining volumes, workforce challenges and other barriers to providing care. That impact continued in FY2023 for many rural hospitals. However, because the OSF HealthCare hospitals with 100 beds or less are part of a 16-hospital health care system, during FY23 they continued to realize benefits traditionally have already had support as a critical care hospital. These benefits include supporting operations and services, supplies, leverage of staffing and navigation of the regulatory and financial challenges related to the pandemic. Further, some areas that the OSF critical care hospitals do not independently need to support include centralized services such as revenue cycle, accounts payable and receivable, supply chain, sterile processing, human resources and the contact center for ambulatory needs.

Because these OSF hospitals are connected to a larger system, they are able to scale their delivery system, adjust care models, share clinicians and leverage digital tools developed by the health care system to provide services such as virtual hospitalists and nurse triage, and ICU remote patient monitoring. In addition, some patient populations have access to remote patient monitoring and 24/7 access to a digital care team to help them manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, COPD and asthma. Further, support for pregnant and postpartum women in Illinois on Medicaid is also available.

One area that these hospitals do continue to struggle with, however, is vaccine hesitancy in their communities. This hesitancy is no longer just for COVID-19, but currently extends to the recent measles outbreak that has been reported in the state.",Christopher Curry,President,(309) 680-1501,Christopher.M.Curry@osfhealthcare.org,Samuel Koury,Senior Financial Analyst,(309) 308-6101,Samuel.A.Koury@osfhealthcare.org,Samuel Koury,Senior Financial Analyst,4/15/2024,"TCH was 100% acquired by OSF on 10/1/23.

We continue to allow remote workers for our PFS/HIM/Acctg and other support staff.  We have some shortages with nursing, lab and ambulance workers.  We are using some travling staff mainly in Medical Surgical floor, and emergency room.  We hired two lab Techs from the Phillipines in prior years and hired an additional staff member from the Philipines in 2023 to address the lab tech shortage.  Supply chain continues to an issue with delays and price increases.  
As a critical access hospital, we need to transfer patients with more serious illness to other larger acute hospitals. The availability of beds for sicker patients and for mental health patients is a bigger issue than before as surrounding hospitals struggle with staffing and have closed specific services such as mental health.  Patients are experiencing delays in care because we can't transfer them to the appropriate setting. With some closures and staffing issues in other regional hospitals we are seeing an influx of patients to our emergency room and quick care setting as they face long waits in other communities.  This increase in volumes along with staff in issues have but more stress on our hospital and its resources than COVID.
 
 
 
Fiscal/Calendar year 2022:
 
 Many of the same challenges experienced in 2020 and 2021 continued in 2022.  We continue to allow remote workers.  Staffing shortages were felt in many departments as people did not come back to work or didn't want to work because of the pandemic. We have had to utilized contracted traveling nurses in several of our departments such as Medical Surgical floors, Emergency room and also in Lab as there is a shortage of Lab Techs.  We also have felt the increase in starting wages due to state mandate, this has caused significant compression with staff that has been in jobs for longer periods of time. It also has decreased staff for some of our entry level positions as they can make more in different industires.   Staff has been stressed and feeling burned out due to the different spikes in COVID cases. As a critical access hospital, we need to transfer patients with more serious illness to other larger acute hospitals. The availability of beds for sicker patients and for mental health patients continues to be an issue with patients experiencing delays in care because we can't transfer them to the appropriate setting. 
 
Supply change is a continued issue with shortages, delays and large price increases. Many of the strategies that were implemented in CY20 and CY 21 continued into CY, such as visitor restrictions, masks and screening of patients. On the positive side, we are experiencing higher volumes in our ancillary departments due to wait times and access issues at larger facilities. 
 
 
 
 
 Calendar year 2020:
The State of Illinois mandated a stop to all elective surgeries and all non-essential services on 3/20/20 we stopped elective surgeries closed several of the departments such as Physical Occupational and Speech Therapy, Pulmonary Function testing, Sleep Lab and our gym. We only provided emergency, imaging and lab testing. Our three rural health clinics started providing telehealth services and cancelled wellness visits and few patients were seen in the clinics. We did not and do not have a specific telehealth platform, so providers were making telephone calls and began implementing Zoom visits.  
We closed our Active gym and all therapy related exercise programs such as SAIL, MedFit and Cardiac Phase 3 Rehab. The Cafe was closed to outside visitors and only served limited meals to staff. All of these closures decreased our revenue which has not totally recovered.
 
On 5/6/2020, some services were allowed but volumes were not what were budgeted and  Illinois was shut down again in November restricting some of the services. During the subsequent shut downs, elective surgeries were performed but all of the exercise programs and the cafe were closed again. 
 
We experienced a shortage of PPE and other cleaning and necessary supplies during the course of the year.  Some of the items needed to operate are on still on an allocation based on Oct, Nov. and Dec. 2019 usage of the supply.  So we have had issues obtaining surgical drapes and supplies due to those volumes.  We have seen substantial increases in PPE and necessary supplies.  For instance glove prices have increased 300%.  We have also seen delays in obtaining supplies which has caused us to try and stock pile necessary items when we can get them which then lead to a shortage of storage space. 
 
 
In order to have beds for potential COVID inpatients swing bed & inpatient services were restricted  We have issues transferring higher acuity patients to other hospitals so must limit some capacity to allow for those patients. We had to plan for the worst possible scenario regarding COVID patient surges.  We limited visitors in the ED and inpatient rooms which caused issues with patient families and stress on our nursing staff.  
 
 
We have added screening desk staff to asses patients before entry into the building and continue through 2021 to have this extra staff.  
 
We have had expenses to allow staff to work remotely if possible.  Throughout the months of the pandemic we have not furloughed or reduced staff hourly rates. We did not cut any benefits and continue to fund their retirement matching. We have experienced some morale issues with staff working with the COVID patients with staff experiencing burnout and isolation and fear. 
 
While the Federal Government through the stimulus package provided funding.  The continuing changing rules have caused more stress on the Finance staff to understand the rules, try and calculate incremental costs and costs paid by other sources that we find it will be difficult to support keeping the funds even though we have had extra costs and lost revenue.  
 
During 2021:
Many of the same challenges experienced in 2020 continued in 2021.  We continue to allow remote workers.  Additional challenges experienced were coverage due to staff illness or members of the family.  The continued fluctuation of the school and day care openings caused challenges for staff to find care for their children which let to staffing issues. Staffing shortages were felt in many departments as people did not come back to work or didn't want to work because of the pandemic.  We also have felt the increase in starting wages which has caused significant compression with staff that has been in jobs for longer periods of time.  Staff has been stressed and feeling burned out due to the different spikes in COVID cases. 
 
Supply change is a continued issue with shortages, delays and large price increases. Many of the strategies that were implemented in CY20 continued into CY1, such as visitor restrictions, masks and screening of patients.

These challenges have been particularly severe for rural hospitals that were already struggling with shrinking margins, declining volumes, workforce challenges and other barriers to providing care. That impact continued in FY2023 for many rural hospitals. However, because the OSF HealthCare hospitals with 100 beds or less are part of a 16-hospital health care system, during FY23 they continued to realize benefits traditionally have already had support as a critical care hospital. These benefits include supporting operations and services, supplies, leverage of staffing and navigation of the regulatory and financial challenges related to the pandemic. Further, some areas that the OSF critical care hospitals do not independently need to support include centralized services such as revenue cycle, accounts payable and receivable, supply chain, sterile processing, human resources and the contact center for ambulatory needs.

Because these OSF hospitals are connected to a larger system, they are able to scale their delivery system, adjust care models, share clinicians and leverage digital tools developed by the health care system to provide services such as virtual hospitalists and nurse triage, and ICU remote patient monitoring. In addition, some patient populations have access to remote patient monitoring and 24/7 access to a digital care team to help them manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, COPD and asthma. Further, support for pregnant and postpartum women in Illinois on Medicaid is also available.

One area that these hospitals do continue to struggle with, however, is vaccine hesitancy in their communities. This hesitancy is no longer just for COVID-19, but currently extends to the recent measles outbreak that has been reported in the state.",Dawn Trompeter,President,(815)539-1464,Dawn.C.Trompeter@osfhealthcare.org,Marisa Kibble,Senior Financial Analyst,(815)539-1466,Marisa.A.Kibble@osfhealthcare.org,Dawn Trompeter,President,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023

While we were thankful for the lessons learned and strength that prevailed during this time, we continue to see some of the same struggles and some new ones coming forward. Rural hospitals are markedly challenged as COVID not only promoted but enforced remote working environments. This new climate makes it particularly difficult for organizations in which human resources were already scarce. Not only nursing positions, but entry level positions are increasingly harder to fill, given the vast amount of remote working opportunities available. We have become very creative not only how we recruit colleagues but also shifted our perspective on retaining. Efforts are highly focused on colleague development and growth. Due to inflation and the overall shift in the market, we have seen large salary swings through travel agencies, bonuses, base pay, and more. This in conjunction with supply costs has led to a spike in expenses causing organizations to look at their resources differently and become better stewards to maintain stability for the future. While resources continue to remain a top priority for rural hospitals, we also saw colleague safety rise to the top. Throughout COVID there was much concern for healthcare workers’ exposure and subsequent risk; however, while we see a steady decline in COVID numbers, healthcare remains amongst the top in dangerous careers due to the increase in workplace violence. As a shift in mental health diagnosis and treatment facilities continue to see an inverse relationship, hospitals are seeing progressively more violence coming through their doors. Programs to help keep staff safe during these times are not only a priority but necessary. Signs can be seen throughout our hospitals, establishing a zero-tolerance environment for violence. Staff is trained how to de-escalate situations and keep themselves safe. Security is heightened and metal detectors are now present in emergency rooms.

These challenges have been particularly severe for rural hospitals that were already struggling with shrinking margins, declining volumes, workforce challenges and other barriers to providing care. That impact continued in FY2023 for many rural hospitals. However, because the OSF HealthCare hospitals with 100 beds or less are part of a 16-hospital health care system, during FY23 they continued to realize benefits traditionally have already had support as a critical care hospital. These benefits include supporting operations and services, supplies, leverage of staffing and navigation of the regulatory and financial challenges related to the pandemic. Further, some areas that the OSF critical care hospitals do not independently need to support include centralized services such as revenue cycle, accounts payable and receivable, supply chain, sterile processing, human resources and the contact center for ambulatory needs.

Because these OSF hospitals are connected to a larger system, they are able to scale their delivery system, adjust care models, share clinicians and leverage digital tools developed by the health care system to provide services such as virtual hospitalists and nurse triage, and ICU remote patient monitoring. In addition, some patient populations have access to remote patient monitoring and 24/7 access to a digital care team to help them manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, COPD and asthma. Further, support for pregnant and postpartum women in Illinois on Medicaid is also available.

We are no longer staffing or conducting any type of wellness check upon entry, nor are we maintaining any type of visitor restriction to those patients in our Acute Care wing.  The following excerpt is actually the response that we submitted in our last annual survey...but it does reiterate the struggles that we were facing, while in the midst of the pandemic crisis.  




""We have expended a tremendous amount of resources and manpower as part of the pandemic response efforts. For one year of COVID response efforts through March 2021, we estimated that we have spent at least $1 million in staff resources and expenses associated with response efforts. We received over $4 Million in CARES Act Stimulus funding. We did apply for and receive $2.4 million in SBA PPP loans that we anticipate being forgiven. However, guidance keeps changing and the SBA is backlogged on processing and auditing forgiveness applications. As such, there is still so much uncertainty and limitations on utilization of the COVID funding, that we are uncertain how much of the funds we will even be able to keep. 

We have had our incident command activated for over a year now since mid-March 2020. We were holding daily incident command meetings, then reduced that down to 3 days per week and we are currently now at 2 days per week. Staffing the temp check stations has been challenging. At the onset of the pandemic, we used staff temporarily displaced when their department services were shut down. However, once services resumed, it got more difficult to staff the temp check stations and in many cases, it has caused overtime. We are still staffing temp check stations for patients/visitors, incurring additional staffing costs associated with that (approximately $18,000 per month). Our employee entrances at first were staffed with individuals but we eventually switched to automated temp check stations that use facial recognition to read temps that employees then manually log on paper since we don’t electronically archive any data captured on the tablets. It really doesn’t seem logical to continue the temperature taking, since many COVID symptoms have not even included high temperature. We have not heard any IDPH or CDC guidance permitting the discontinuation of the temp check station requirements, which is only adding to the staff shortages and extra costs that could be avoided without an increased risk for exposure.

We have been able to maintain adequate levels of PPE and sanitation cleaners for staff utilization. We’ve just experienced inflationary costs and delivery delays. We have had some staff complain about having to work outside to collect COVID testing swabs in the ER entrance drive-up when it was cold or raining. We had delayed delivery of rain coats that were ordered for staff to utilize, that eventually did arrive. We also changed up the process to address their concerns regarding testing during inclement weather. There were some complaints regarding pressure sores due to extended use of N95 masks while working on the COVID isolation unit. We purchased CAPR hoods for use to address these concerns. Some staff have complained that we didn’t pay COVID hazard pay or pay for picking up extra shifts. However, we already had policies in place to pay time and half for overtime and when staff were called in to cover shifts. We didn’t have to designate a COVID unit on our inpatient floor until around January and we saw the height of our COVID treatment at the first of 2021 (as opposed to patient spikes in urban areas at that the start of the pandemic). We didn’t give hazard pay for working those units because risk of COVID exposure was not limited to just nursing. Reception, housekeeping, ancillary staff, etc. were all at risk. Therefore, paying hazard pay only for specific staff members would not have been equitable.

Dealing with the COVID pandemic has definitely taken a toll on our staff and they are feeling stressed. In rural hospitals, we treated fewer COVID patients than urban areas; however, we didn’t have excess manpower to adequately deal with all the added responsibilities of response efforts, including organizing, communication, developing new policies/processes, tracking new funding and expenses, staffing testing hotlines and specimen collections, administering vaccines, staffing temp stations, etc. This has meant overtime by a lot of staff that has continued for over a year now. It is also hard to find and keep workers because so many prefer to take the unemployment benefits when it is hard enough to find qualified individuals in rural areas. Every employee was impacted in some way or another by the pandemic. We therefore opted to treat all employees equally and did appreciation events routinely throughout the COVID response period. We had cookouts, used COVID grant funds for hospital logo appreciation items like coolers (Keeping Cool Under COVID), gift cards to local businesses (since they were hit hard by COVID and we had some staff with reduced hours during shutdown, the extra money assistance would help show appreciation and compensate for lost time and also those that worked “extra”), logo jackets (since we had to cancel our annual appreciation party). We also did an across-the-board market adjustment January 1, 2021. We couldn’t claim that as COVID funds. However, we didn’t have to give a market adjustment to all employees, just those positions that had to move because of the minimum wage increases. We just figured that helped address any wage compression issues as well as showed our appreciation to all staff for their COVID efforts. We’ve talked about giving COVID bonuses now since it’s surpassed a year that we’ve been dealing with this. However, we are concerned whether HHS will change the guidelines and disqualify a bonus paid out this late in the pandemic.

We did have to reduce a limited amount of work schedules between mid-March through around May 2020 when we could resume services that had to be discontinued during the shutdown. Some staff were relocated to other job functions like housekeeping and temp check stations. Other staff did begin working remotely, if permissible for their job function. Some staff continue to work remotely, if we cannot accommodate social distancing within their on-site workspace. Those with compromised immune systems were permitted to take time off from work while retaining their benefits. All employees were given up to 80 hours of COVID benefit time eligible for use, per defined qualifying factors and could utilize other available benefit time during these periods of time off.

Revenues have been definitely impacted, but we’ve also added new services like aquatic therapy and expanded upon services like adding a full-time general surgeon in October 2020 which have increased revenues in certain areas. Because of the limitations placed on calculating lost revenues for retaining the COVID Stimulus funds, it will make it difficult to carve out these new/expanded services in order to have an accurate impact of what the pandemic did to our operations. As such, that means less COVID funds that we will be able to retain.

Patients have also struggled, given that we’ve had to restrict visitors. Many patients require that family interaction, as well as assistance with understanding their healthcare issues and making decisions. While we did accommodate those situations as permitted within the restrictions, dealing with end-of-life care under such restricted visitation was extremely difficult. Family should have been able to see their loved ones in their final days and the COVID pandemic restrictions prevented that. This will undoubtedly leave lasting scars on many who had to deal with loss, during this time period.""","Randall W.

It is the policy of Loyola University Medical Center (“LUMC”) to utilize certified Minority-Owned Business Enterprise (“MBE”), Woman-Owned Business Enterprise (“WBE”), Disadvantaged-Owned Business Enterprise (“DBE”), and Veteran-Owned Business Enterprise (“VBE”) in the performance of contracts, to promote parity in the award of and participation in contracts, to eliminate arbitrary barriers, and to fill participation in contracts by all qualified persons, regardless of sex, sexual orientation, race, or ethnicity.  It is also the policy of LUMC to promote opportunities, which encourage minorities, and women, on the workforce, and to implement mechanisms to assist in providing for community and local residency hiring of qualified individuals on LUMC’s construction projects.","We utilize our invitation to bid (ITB) process to advertise our projects to the diverse marketplace. We now require participation from our prime contractors (general contractors), and mandate that they engage and utilize diverse partners on our projects.","Communication and education across our pre-qualified pool of general contractors and professional services firms has been difficult, but key in ensuring participation across all of our projects. Now that we require diversity participation on our capital construction projects, the vendors have engaged the MBE/WBE/DBE/VBE/SBE marketplace. In addition, healthcare is a specialized segment of the construction market that requires specific skills and experience working in and around patients. As more and more diverse firms are exposed to and work within healthcare facilities, we feel there will be a larger pool of diverse contractors, vendors and designers with the requisite experience to work in these sensitive buildings.",More vendor fairs and training for specialty and sub-contractors in the healthcare market would benefit this segment of the construction industry. Promoting awareness of the specialized requirements to work in healthcare facilities would ensure vendors looking for opportunities in this market understand the critical nature and care of this work.,"We recognize and accept the following: 
A current certification letter from the City of Chicago, Cook County, the State of Illinois Central Management Services, Illinois Department of Transportation, Chicago Minority Supplier Development Council, National Minority Supplier Development Council, Women’s Business Development Council or any local governmental agency for diversity subcontractors and suppliers identified as part of the contract.","Any potential vendor/supplier interested in opportunities should register with Trinity Health at the following link:

These challenges have been particularly severe for rural hospitals that were already struggling with shrinking margins, declining volumes, workforce challenges and other barriers to providing care. That impact continued in FY2023 for many rural hospitals. However, because the OSF HealthCare hospitals with 100 beds or less are part of a 16-hospital health care system, during FY23 they continued to realize benefits traditionally have already had support as a critical care hospital. These benefits include supporting operations and services, supplies, leverage of staffing and navigation of the regulatory and financial challenges related to the pandemic. Further, some areas that the OSF critical care hospitals do not independently need to support include centralized services such as revenue cycle, accounts payable and receivable, supply chain, sterile processing, human resources and the contact center for ambulatory needs.

Because these OSF hospitals are connected to a larger system, they are able to scale their delivery system, adjust care models, share clinicians and leverage digital tools developed by the health care system to provide services such as virtual hospitalists and nurse triage, and ICU remote patient monitoring. In addition, some patient populations have access to remote patient monitoring and 24/7 access to a digital care team to help them manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, COPD and asthma. Further, support for pregnant and postpartum women in Illinois on Medicaid is also available.

Past priorities and obligations  no longer carry the same weight, especially now that technical advancements allow people to connect with the outside world, without having to leave their home. 

In our community, it seems that people are protecting their time more and engaging in extracurriculars less. They are no longer interested in attending a support group when they can access Facebook support groups at all hours of the day or night, or in attending a health conference when a Youtube video provides all the same material in half the amount of time, or meeting in person when a virtual meeting can eliminate the travel time to and from. 

This even flows over to patients getting preventive health care. Patients were told for years to stay away, stay protected, stay safe. It was accepted to postpone non-urgent healthcare needs. Now, we see patients coming in with higher acuity conditions that should have been identified and/or monitored earlier through yearly wellness exams, screening mammograms/colonscopies, etc. This new cultural mindset minimizes the importance of preventive and population health. 

It is a much larger issue than we can change on our own. However, Red Bud applied for and received a grant from ICAHN that will be used to do community education and to raise awareness for outpatient preventive health.",Jennifer Gregson,Chief Administrative Officer,618-282-5107,JGregson@qhcus.com,Meghan Markotay,Executive Assistant,618-282-5104,MMarkotay@qhcus.com,Janel Voss,Controller,4/15/2024,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2023
