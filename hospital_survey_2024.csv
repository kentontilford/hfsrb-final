For Each Rfp That We Solicit From The Vendor Community We Strive To Include Diverse Suppliers, If Available.

We Do Not Have Goals For Specific Diversity Spend Requirements IN Each Category And Are IN The Earlier Stages Of Developing These Goals For Our System.",Invitations To Bid Alert Prospective Vendors Of Our Diversity Participation Goals. We Strive To Incorporate This IN All Projects As Awareness Of Goals Has Already Increased Participation. We Are Actively Using Supplier Gateway And Published That To The Vendor Community.,"Due To The Nature Of Construction Projects Executed Within The Healthcare Environment, Only Experienced Contractors Are Considered To Perform Work Within These Sensitive Environments. With The Current State Of The Chicagoland Market And High Diversity Requirements IN Many Large Competing Projects, Most Qualified Labor Has Been Engaged IN These Projects Making Them Unavailable OR Unfavorable Economically. We Are Seeing Some General Contractors Employing Inexperienced Diverse Vendors And Helping Them To Gain Experience IN Larger Projects, This Has Been Beneficial. Capital Equipment Is Generally Selected By Clinicians With Familiarity With The Equipment And Many Large Vendors Have Strong Relationships With Clinicians. Most Diverse Suppliers Costs Incrementally More Than Non Diverse Suppliers. With Our Margin Being So Meager As An Organization We Have To Find The Win/Win Solutions Where A Diverse Suppliers Can Be A Lower Cost Provider And Help The Community.",Invest IN Encouraging Talent Recruitment And Development. Need To Get These Diverse Suppliers On Par With Their Competitors From A Depth And Sophistication Perspective. Invest Funds IN The Diverse Suppliers IN Our Community To Lower Their Operating Costs That Would Improve Their Costs To Us Going Forward. OR Provide A Grant To Organizations Like Ours To Subsidize The Cost Increase Of Diverse Suppliers. Compiling Consolidated Lists Of Diverse Vendors As A Guide To Organizations Can Help To Bring Awareness Of What Diverse Vendors Exist Within The Market.,"We Require Certification By A Recognized Third-Party And Require A Copy Of That Certification. Some Recognized Organizations Include: Local OR National Minority Supplier Development Councils Woman Owned Business Development Centers Local, State OR Federal Government Agencies Nationally Recognized Chamber Of Commerce",Contact Should Be Made Through The Supply Chain Category Management Team OR IN Response To A Bid Request. Potential Vendor/Suppliers Should Make Themselves Available To General Contractors And Project Managers IN Healthcare Construction.,"IN Working With The Category Management Team, OR Construction Project Managers, The Vendor/Supplier Will Provide Documentation If Awarded As A Vendor And They Will Be Recognized IN Our 3rd Party Tool.","Our Construction Teams Look To Many Of The General Contractors IN The Chicagoland Area And Discuss Those Diverse Partnerships They Have Formed.

External Outreach: Hph’s Material Management Team Will Keep Track Of Known Diverse Suppliers And Contractors To Inform Them Of Upcoming Capital Expenditure Opportunities. This Will Involve Maintaining An On-Going Vendor Database That Allows Us To Search For Vendors That Are Mwv Owned. Given That Our Materials Management Team Serves As The Gatekeeper For Capital Expenditures, This Team Will Always Review Potential Mwe Vendors IN Hph’s Vendor Database To Determine If There Are Any Mwv Vendors That May Potentially Meet The Needs Of The Requested Capital Expenditure. Hph Will Begin To Put Processes IN Place To Utilize Existing Networks And Partnerships With Diversity Organizations, Minority Business Enterprises (mbes), And Women Business Enterprises (wbes) To Reach Out To A Broader Pool Of Potential Suppliers And Contractors. This Also Entails Attending Industry Events, Conferences, And Networking Opportunities Focused On Diversity And Inclusion To Connect With New Suppliers And Contractors. Promotion Through Various Channels: Hph Will Leverage Its Website And Social Media Channels To Publicly Announce Their Commitment To Supplier And Contractor Diversity And Highlight Upcoming Opportunities. Hph’s Materials Management And Marketing Teams Will Work Together To Issue Press Releases And Articles IN Local Newspapers And Industry Publications To Raise Awareness Within The Community And Among Relevant Stakeholders. This Also Entails Including Information About The Initiative IN Relevant Procurement Documents, Such As Bid Notices And Requests For Proposals (rfps), To Ensure That Potential Suppliers And Contractors Are Aware Of Hph’s Commitment To Diversity. Training And Resources: Hph Will Provide Training And Resources To Its Materials Management Staff Responsible For The Procurement Process As Well As All Operational Stakeholders Involved IN The Vendor Decision-Making Process. The Goal Of The Training Will Be To Ensure That They Understand The Importance Of Diversity And Inclusion And Are Equipped To Evaluate And Select Diverse Suppliers And Contractors Fairly And Objectively. Measurement And Reporting: Hph Will Establish Metrics And Benchmarks To Track Progress IN Promoting Supplier And Contractor Diversity And Regularly Report On These Metrics To Internal And External Stakeholders. As Hph Improves Its Processes To Increase Supplier Diversity, We Will Celebrate Successes And Share Best Practices To Inspire Ongoing Commitment To Diversity And Inclusion Throughout Hph And The Broader Community. Feedback Mechanism: Hph Will Establish A Feedback Mechanism To Solicit Input From Diverse Suppliers And Contractors On Their Experiences Working With Hph And Identify Opportunities For Improvement. Hph Will Use This Feedback To Continuously Refine And Enhance The Hospital's Approach To Promoting Supplier And Contractor Diversity. By Implementing Such A Comprehensive Plan, Hph Can Effectively Alert And Encourage Its Internal Stakeholders And External Enterprises Of Its Efforts To Promote Supplier And Contractor Diversity IN Upcoming Planned Capital Expenditures, Fostering A More Inclusive And Equitable Procurement Process.","At This Time, Humboldt Park Health (hph) Does Not Have A Formal Mwv Program To Identify OR Promote Participation As A Mwv Vendor But Is IN The Initial Stages Of Formalizing A Process.","Limited Resources To Build An Infrastructure To Capture, Validate Mwv Vendors, And Report","At This Time, Hph Does Not Hold OR Recognize Any Certifications Related To The Recruitment Of Diversely-Owned Vendors/Supplies.

Presentations Historically Made To Members Of Black Contractors United, African American Contractors Association, Hispanic American Construction Industry Association, Federation Of Women Contractors, And Other Advocacy OR Contracting Membership Organization Seeking Information On An Upcoming Major Project. - Participation At All Prebid Activities Wherein Project Focused Information Is Provided To Potential Bidders Including Contracting Utilization Goals And Workforce Goals As Applicable. Anticipated Outcome - Complete Competitive Bid With M/Wbe Utilization Provided On Bid Day. - Minority And Women Owned Firm Participation Applied To Every Project. These Goals Are Stated IN Specific Request For Proposal Documents So That Potential Bidders Clearly Understand Our Intention To Award Stated Percentages Of The Project To Diverse Firms. - Bidders List Review Prior To Solicitation By Construction Management Firm OR General Contractor To Assure That The Certified Minority And Woman Owned Firms Are Notified And Solicitation For Participation On The Specific Project. - Implementing Compliance Processes Throughout All Phases Of Project To Assure That Minority And Woman Owned Firms Are Actually Participating On The Project And Are Being Paid Consistent With Prompt Pay Provisions IN The Contract.",While We Have Managed To Successfully Mitigate Most Challenges Encountered IN The Implementation Of Our Diversity Program We Still Have Challenges Identifying Certified Minority And Women Owned Firms IN Particular Trade Areas Specifically Plumbing And Mechanical (hvac). Firms Do Exist IN These Service Areas But They Are Low IN Number. The Lack Of Availability Compromises Our Ability To Achieve Maximum Participation IN This Functional Area. A Strategy We Are Implementing Started With An Availability Exercise Wherein We Sought To Identify All Certified Firms IN This Geographic Area Working IN The Area Of Focus. We Were Hoping To Identify Emerging And/OR Newly Certified Firms That May Not Be On Our Bidders' List. We Try To Help Emerging Plumbing And Mechanical Firms With Mentor/Protege Agreements With Larger Firms.,"The Ihfsrb Can Assist IN Our Efforts By Continuing To Encourage Others To Develop And Implement Robust Supplier/Contractor Utilization Programs. By Providing Certified, Diverse Firms With The Opportunity Of A Consistent Flow Of Work That They Have A Real Possibility Of Winning, These Firms Have The Possibility Of Increasing Their Technical Capacity And Financial Depth. These Firms Will Become Organizationally Healthy And Will Be Able To Hire More Workers And Take On Larger And More Complex Jobs. They Will Become Better Business Partners For Us All.",* City Of Chicago * Cook County * State Of Illinois And/OR Its Agencies * Womens Business Development Center OR Any Of Its Affiliate Councils * Chicago Minority Business Development Council And/OR Any Of Its Affiliate Councils * National Minority Business Supplier Development Council And/OR Any Of Its Affiliate Councils,"Alder Derose Director, Business Diversity & Construction Compliance 850 East 58th Street Room 410 Chicago, Illinois 60637 773-834-5222",A Contractor/Supplier Does Not Have To Enroll.

Small Firms Cannot Wait 45 To 60 Days For Payment. *look At Your Hospital's Payment Processes. How Long Does It Take To Pay Suppliers, Vendors, Contractors? It May Be A Bit Difficult Initially To Recruit Diverse Firms. There Is A Cost Associated With Bidding Work And Small Firms Often Times Focus Their Efforts On Preparing And Submitting Bidding Bids To Organizations Where They Believe They Have A Fair Chance Of Being Successful. An Organization Without A Track Record Of Utilizing Diverse Firms Will Have To Build Trust. Do Not Simply Send The Solicitation To The Diverse Firm And Then Bemoan The Fact They Did Not Respond. Pick Up The Phone And Call The Firm. Ask Them To Look At The Solicitation And Bid Your Work. Assure Them Of Your Intention To Utilize Diverse Firms And Your Intention To Maintain A Level Playing Field Upon Which They Have A Fair Chance Of Landing Business With Your Hospital. Consider Hosting Some Type Of Activity Where You Introduce The Firms To Decision Makers IN Your Organization. Take Care To Emphasize The Validity Of Your Program Assuring Them That Your Efforts Are Not Merely ""window Dressing"".

These Goals Are Stated IN Specific Request For Proposal Documents So That Potential Bidders Clearly Understand Our Intention To Award Stated Percentages Of The Project To Diverse Firms. -Bidders List Review Prior To Solicitation By Construction Management Firm OR General Contractor To Assure That The Certified Minority And Woman Owned Firms Are Notified And Solicitation For Participation On The Specific Project. -Implementing Compliance Processes Throughout All Phases Of Project To Assure That Minority And Woman Owned Firms Are Actually Participating On The Project And Are Being Paid Consistent With Prompt Pay Provisions IN The Contract.",While We Have Managed To Successfully Mitigate Most Challenges Encountered IN The Implementation Of Our Diversity Program We Still Have Challenges Identifying Certified Minority And Women Owned Firms IN Particular Trade Areas Specifically Plumbing And Mechanical (hvac). Firms Do Exist IN These Service Areas But They Are Low IN Number. The Lack Of Availability Compromises Our Ability To Achieve Maximum Participation IN This Functional Area. A Strategy We Are Implementing Started With An Availability Exercise Wherein We Sought To Identify All Certified Firms IN This Geographic Area Working IN The Area Of Focus.

By Providing Certified, Diverse Firms With The Opportunity Of A Consistent Flow Of Work That They Have A Real Possibility Of Winning, These Firms Have The Possibility Of Increasing Their Technical Capacity And Financial Depth.

Is There A Payment Bottleneck IN Your Process That Can Be Eliminated? It May Be A Bit Difficult Initially To Recruit Diverse Firms. There Is A Cost Associated With Bidding Work And Small Firms Often Times Focus Their Efforts On Preparing And Submitting Bidding Bids To Organizations Where They Believe They Have A Fair Chance Of Being Successful. An Organization Without A Track Record OR Utilizing Diverse Firms Will Have To Build Trust. Do Not Simply Send The Solicitation To The Diverse Firm And Then Bemoan The Fact They Did Not Respond. Pick Up The Phone And Call The Firm. Ask Them To Look At The Solicitation And Bid Your Work. Assure Them Of Your Intention To Utilize Diverse Firms And Your Intention To Maintain A Level Playing Field Upon Which They Have A Fair Chance OR Landing Business With Your Hospital. Consider Hosting Some Type Of Activity Where You Introduce The Firms To Decision Makers IN Your Organization.

We Do Not Have A Good Way To Currently Track This IN Our Ehr System. Our Figures On This Survey Are Reflective Of Total Lab Tests Performed, As We Have Completed This Survey IN The Past. 4. Minor Estimation IN Some Areas Has Been Done IN Order To Complete The Survey. 5. Due To The Limitations Of Our Ehr System, You Will Notice Negative Revenue IN The Self Pay Net Revenue Figures. This Is Most Likely Due To ""transfers"" IN The System, But The Data Available Is Not Easily Broken Out (ie - Transfer From Medicare To ""self-Pay After Medicare"" & Transfer From Medicaid To ""self-Pay After Medicaid""). We Also Have ""reserves/Allowances"" For Outstanding A/R And The Bad Debt Reserve Amount Has Been Allocated/Estimated According To %'s IN Our Model. 6. For Net Revenue, We Are Taking Contractual Adjustments, Bad Debt, And Other Revenue Deductions Into Account. 7. This Year, We Have Home Health Visits That We've Added & Dialysis Days Of Hemo. 8. This Year, We Didn't Include Anything For Charity Care, After An Email Response Received On 3/31/25 That Clarified Charity Means No Financial Aid...in Previous Surveys, We Were Treating It As Financial Aid, Much Like The Medicare Cost Report.
