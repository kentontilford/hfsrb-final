We Have Reached Out To Our Local Contractors To Encourage Them To Review The States Requirements To Become Listed As Qualified Vendors. Given Our Rural Location And The Limited Number Of Qualified Contractors IN Our Area, We May Not Be Able To Add Many Additional Qualified Contractors To Our List. Two Our Largest Repetitive Contractors, Sm Wilson And Hbd Construction, Have Both Committed Their Businesses To Diversity IN Hiring And Subcontracting. For Reference, We Searched Adams, Brown, Hancock, Pike And Schuyler Counties And Only Found A Handful Of Certified Vendors And Of Those Listed, Less Than 1/2 Are Construction Related.

Many Of Our Largest Contractors Have Missouri Based Locations. We Have No Qualified Contractors Listed On The State Of Illinois Database Within Our Area. Howerve, We Do Contract With Qualified Contractors Out Of Missouri And Will Report That Information IN This Section. We Have Reached Out To Our Local Contractors To Encourage Them To Review The States Requirements To Become Listed As Qualified Vendors. Given Our Rural Location And The Limited Number Of Qualified Contractors IN Our Area, We May Not Be Able To Add Many Additional Qualified Contractors To Our List. Two Our Largest Repetitive Contractors, Sm Wilson And Hbd Construction, Have Both Committed Their Businesses To Diversity IN Hiring And Subcontracting. For Reference, We Searched Adams, Brown, Hancock, Pike And Schuyler Counties And Only Found A Handful Of Certified Vendors And Of Those Listed, Less Than 1/2 Are Construction Related. None Of Those Contractors Are Qualified To Perform The Work We Need On Large Projects.",

Manof Of Our General Contractors Also Have Active Programs To Sek Out And Encourage Women Owned, Minority Owned, Veteran Owned, And Small Business Subcontractors. We Fully Support And Ask That Our General Contractors Place An Emphasis IN This Area. Often, Our Major Capital Expenditures Are With National And/OR International Medical Device And Software Companies. These Expenditures Are Subject To Limited Choices. As A Result, They Drive Up The Total Expeditures By Millions Of Dollars And Leave Us Little Room To Set And/OR Met Meaningful Goals For Diverse Suppliers...especially IN Times When We Are Attempting To Restrict Investments. All Of These National Vendors Are Committed To Diversity IN Their Own Hiring.",
    "Plan for Diversity Recruitment": "We Encourage Our Construction Manager Partners To Include Language IN All Bidding Invitations To Encourage Bid Submissions From Qualified Construction Contractors With Relevant Healthcare Experience, Including Any Women Owned, Minority Owned, Veteran Owned, And Small Business Enterprises To Bid On Pur Projects.",
    "Challenges to Diversity Recruitment": "IN Our Area, We Lack Qualifiend And Experienced Contractors Who Able To Bid On Our Specialized Projects. We Are On The Border Of Missouri And Many Of Our Contractor Resources Are Missouri Based Businesses Who Have Little To No Incentive To Register/Certify With Illinois.",
    "HSFRB Assistance": "To Increase Supplier Diversity, We Could Use Guidance On The Classification Of Contractors And Best Practices To Solicit Contractors Who Are Certified/Registered. The State Needs To Be More Proactive IN Recruitment And Promotion Of Certification And Its Benefits So A More Expansive List Of Qualified Businesses Are Available.
