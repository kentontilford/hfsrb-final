    "plan_for_diversity_recruitment": "To Effectively Promote Supplier And Contractor Diversity IN Upcoming Planned Capital Expenditures, Hph Will Implement A Multifaceted Approach That Involves Communication, Outreach, And Collaboration. Internal Communication: Internal Communication Within The Hospital Is Crucial To Ensure That All Relevant Departments And Stakeholders Are Aware Of The Initiative To Promote Supplier And Contractor Diversity. Efforts To Increase Organizational Awareness Of This Initiative Will Involve Memos, Emails, Presentations To Key Personnel, Including Hph’s Materials Management Team, Departmental Leadership, And The Hph Executive Team. External Outreach: Hph’s Material Management Team Will Keep Track Of Known Diverse Suppliers And Contractors To Inform Them Of Upcoming Capital Expenditure Opportunities. This Will Involve Maintaining An On-Going Vendor Database That Allows Us To Search For Vendors That Are Mwv Owned. Given That Our Materials Management Team Serves As The Gatekeeper For Capital Expenditures, This Team Will Always Review Potential Mwe Vendors IN Hph’s Vendor Database To Determine If There Are Any Mwv Vendors That May Potentially Meet The Needs Of The Requested Capital Expenditure. Hph Will Begin To Put Processes IN Place To Utilize Existing Networks And Partnerships With Diversity Organizations, Minority Business Enterprises (mbes), And Women Business Enterprises (wbes) To Reach Out To A Broader Pool Of Potential Suppliers And Contractors. This Also Entails Attending Industry Events, Conferences, And Networking Opportunities Focused On Diversity And Inclusion To Connect With New Suppliers And Contractors. Promotion Through Various Channels: Hph Will Leverage Its Website And Social Media Channels To Publicly Announce Their Commitment To Supplier And Contractor Diversity And Highlight Upcoming Opportunities. Hph’s Materials Management And Marketing Teams Will Work Together To Issue Press Releases And Articles IN Local Newspapers And Industry Publications To Raise Awareness Within The Community And Among Relevant Stakeholders. This Also Entails Including Information About The Initiative IN Relevant Procurement Documents, Such As Bid Notices And Requests For Proposals (rfps), To Ensure That Potential Suppliers And Contractors Are Aware Of Hph’s Commitment To Diversity. Training And Resources: Hph Will Provide Training And Resources To Its Materials Management Staff Responsible For The Procurement Process As Well As All Operational Stakeholders Involved IN The Vendor Decision-Making Process. The Goal Of The Training Will Be To Ensure That They Understand The Importance Of Diversity And Inclusion And Are Equipped To Evaluate And Select Diverse Suppliers And Contractors Fairly And Objectively. Measurement And Reporting: Hph Will Establish Metrics And Benchmarks To Track Progress IN Promoting Supplier And Contractor Diversity And Regularly Report On These Metrics To Internal And External Stakeholders. As Hph Improves Its Processes To Increase Supplier Diversity, We Will Celebrate Successes And Share Best Practices To Inspire Ongoing Commitment To Diversity And Inclusion Throughout Hph And The Broader Community. Feedback Mechanism: Hph Will Establish A Feedback Mechanism To Solicit Input From Diverse Suppliers And Contractors On Their Experiences Working With Hph And Identify Opportunities For Improvement. Hph Will Use This Feedback To Continuously Refine And Enhance The Hospital's Approach To Promoting Supplier And Contractor Diversity. By Implementing Such A Comprehensive Plan, Hph Can Effectively Alert And Encourage Its Internal Stakeholders And External Enterprises Of Its Efforts To Promote Supplier And Contractor Diversity IN Upcoming Planned Capital Expenditures, Fostering A More Inclusive And Equitable Procurement Process.",

    "Plan for Diversity Recruitment": "To Effectively Promote Supplier And Contractor Diversity IN Upcoming Planned Capital Expenditures, Hph Will Implement A Multifaceted Approach That Involves Communication, Outreach, And Collaboration. Internal Communication: Internal Communication Within The Hospital Is Crucial To Ensure That All Relevant Departments And Stakeholders Are Aware Of The Initiative To Promote Supplier And Contractor Diversity. Efforts To Increase Organizational Awareness Of This Initiative Will Involve Memos, Emails, Presentations To Key Personnel, Including Hph’s Materials Management Team, Departmental Leadership, And The Hph Executive Team. External Outreach: Hph’s Material Management Team Will Keep Track Of Known Diverse Suppliers And Contractors To Inform Them Of Upcoming Capital Expenditure Opportunities. This Will Involve Maintaining An On-Going Vendor Database That Allows Us To Search For Vendors That Are Mwv Owned. Given That Our Materials Management Team Serves As The Gatekeeper For Capital Expenditures, This Team Will Always Review Potential Mwe Vendors IN Hph’s Vendor Database To Determine If There Are Any Mwv Vendors That May Potentially Meet The Needs Of The Requested Capital Expenditure. Hph Will Begin To Put Processes IN Place To Utilize Existing Networks And Partnerships With Diversity Organizations, Minority Business Enterprises (mbes), And Women Business Enterprises (wbes) To Reach Out To A Broader Pool Of Potential Suppliers And Contractors. This Also Entails Attending Industry Events, Conferences, And Networking Opportunities Focused On Diversity And Inclusion To Connect With New Suppliers And Contractors. Promotion Through Various Channels: Hph Will Leverage Its Website And Social Media Channels To Publicly Announce Their Commitment To Supplier And Contractor Diversity And Highlight Upcoming Opportunities. Hph’s Materials Management And Marketing Teams Will Work Together To Issue Press Releases And Articles IN Local Newspapers And Industry Publications To Raise Awareness Within The Community And Among Relevant Stakeholders. This Also Entails Including Information About The Initiative IN Relevant Procurement Documents, Such As Bid Notices And Requests For Proposals (rfps), To Ensure That Potential Suppliers And Contractors Are Aware Of Hph’s Commitment To Diversity. Training And Resources: Hph Will Provide Training And Resources To Its Materials Management Staff Responsible For The Procurement Process As Well As All Operational Stakeholders Involved IN The Vendor Decision-Making Process. The Goal Of The Training Will Be To Ensure That They Understand The Importance Of Diversity And Inclusion And Are Equipped To Evaluate And Select Diverse Suppliers And Contractors Fairly And Objectively. Measurement And Reporting: Hph Will Establish Metrics And Benchmarks To Track Progress IN Promoting Supplier And Contractor Diversity And Regularly Report On These Metrics To Internal And External Stakeholders. As Hph Improves Its Processes To Increase Supplier Diversity, We Will Celebrate Successes And Share Best Practices To Inspire Ongoing Commitment To Diversity And Inclusion Throughout Hph And The Broader Community. Feedback Mechanism: Hph Will Establish A Feedback Mechanism To Solicit Input From Diverse Suppliers And Contractors On Their Experiences Working With Hph And Identify Opportunities For Improvement. Hph Will Use This Feedback To Continuously Refine And Enhance The Hospital's Approach To Promoting Supplier And Contractor Diversity. By Implementing Such A Comprehensive Plan, Hph Can Effectively Alert And Encourage Its Internal Stakeholders And External Enterprises Of Its Efforts To Promote Supplier And Contractor Diversity IN Upcoming Planned Capital Expenditures, Fostering A More Inclusive And Equitable Procurement Process.",
    "Challenges to Diversity Recruitment": "At This Time, Humboldt Park Health (hph) Does Not Have A Formal Mwv Program To Identify OR Promote Participation As A Mwv Vendor But Is IN The Initial Stages Of Formalizing A Process.",
