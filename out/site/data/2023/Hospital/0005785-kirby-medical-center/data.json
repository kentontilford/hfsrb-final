    "covid": "Fiscal/Calendar year 2023:\nWe continue to allow remote workers for our PFS/HIM/Acctg and other support staff.  We have some shortages with nursing, lab and ambulance workers.  We are using some travling staff mainly in Medical Surgical floor, and emergency room.  We hired two lab Techs from the Phillipines in prior years and hired an additional staff member from the Philipines in 2023 to address the lab tech shortage.  Supply chain continues to an issue with delays and price increases.  \nAs a critical access hospital, we need to transfer patients with more serious illness to other larger acute hospitals. The availability of beds for sicker patients and for mental health patients is a bigger issue than before as surrounding hospitals struggle with staffing and have closed specific services such as mental health.  Patients are experiencing delays in care because we can't transfer them to the appropriate setting. With some closures and staffing issues in other regional hospitals we are seeing an influx of patients to our emergency room and quick care setting as they face long waits in other communities.  This increase in volumes along with staff in issues have but more stress on our hospital and its resources than COVID.\n \n \n \nFiscal/Calendar year 2022:\n \n Many of the same challenges experienced in 2020 and 2021 continued in 2022.  We continue to allow remote workers.  Staffing shortages were felt in many departments as people did not come back to work or didn't want to work because of the pandemic. We have had to utilized contracted traveling nurses in several of our departments such as Medical Surgical floors, Emergency room and also in Lab as there is a shortage of Lab Techs.  We also have felt the increase in starting wages due to state mandate, this has caused significant compression with staff that has been in jobs for longer periods of time. It also has decreased staff for some of our entry level positions as they can make more in different industires.   Staff has been stressed and feeling burned out due to the different spikes in COVID cases. As a critical access hospital, we need to transfer patients with more serious illness to other larger acute hospitals. The availability of beds for sicker patients and for mental health patients continues to be an issue with patients experiencing delays in care because we can't transfer them to the appropriate setting. \n \nSupply change is a continued issue with shortages, delays and large price increases. Many of the strategies that were implemented in CY20 and CY 21 continued into CY, such as visitor restrictions, masks and screening of patients. On the positive side, we are experiencing higher volumes in our ancillary departments due to wait times and access issues at larger facilities. \n \n \n \n \n Calendar year 2020:\nThe State of Illinois mandated a stop to all elective surgeries and all non-essential services on 3/20/20 we stopped elective surgeries closed several of the departments such as Physical Occupational and Speech Therapy, Pulmonary Function testing, Sleep Lab and our gym. We only provided emergency, imaging and lab testing. Our three rural health clinics started providing telehealth services and cancelled wellness visits and few patients were seen in the clinics. We did not and do not have a specific telehealth platform, so providers were making telephone calls and began implementing Zoom visits.  \nWe closed our Active gym and all therapy related exercise programs such as SAIL, MedFit and Cardiac Phase 3 Rehab. The Cafe was closed to outside visitors and only served limited meals to staff. All of these closures decreased our revenue which has not totally recovered.\n \nOn 5/6/2020, some services were allowed but volumes were not what were budgeted and  Illinois was shut down again in November restricting some of the services. During the subsequent shut downs, elective surgeries were performed but all of the exercise programs and the cafe were closed again. \n \nWe experienced a shortage of PPE and other cleaning and necessary supplies during the course of the year.  Some of the items needed to operate are on still on an allocation based on Oct, Nov. and Dec. 2019 usage of the supply.  So we have had issues obtaining surgical drapes and supplies due to those volumes.  We have seen substantial increases in PPE and necessary supplies.  For instance glove prices have increased 300%.  We have also seen delays in obtaining supplies which has caused us to try and stock pile necessary items when we can get them which then lead to a shortage of storage space. \n \n \nIn order to have beds for potential COVID inpatients swing bed & inpatient services were restricted  We have issues transferring higher acuity patients to other hospitals so must limit some capacity to allow for those patients. We had to plan for the worst possible scenario regarding COVID patient surges.  We limited visitors in the ED and inpatient rooms which caused issues with patient families and stress on our nursing staff.  \n \n \nWe have added screening desk staff to asses patients before entry into the building and continue through 2021 to have this extra staff.  \n \nWe have had expenses to allow staff to work remotely if possible.  Throughout the months of the pandemic we have not furloughed or reduced staff hourly rates. We did not cut any benefits and continue to fund their retirement matching. We have experienced some morale issues with staff working with the COVID patients with staff experiencing burnout and isolation and fear. \n \nWhile the Federal Government through the stimulus package provided funding.  The continuing changing rules have caused more stress on the Finance staff to understand the rules, try and calculate incremental costs and costs paid by other sources that we find it will be difficult to support keeping the funds even though we have had extra costs and lost revenue.  \n \nDuring 2021:\nMany of the same challenges experienced in 2020 continued in 2021.  We continue to allow remote workers.  Additional challenges experienced were coverage due to staff illness or members of the family.  The continued fluctuation of the school and day care openings caused challenges for staff to find care for their children which let to staffing issues. Staffing shortages were felt in many departments as people did not come back to work or didn't want to work because of the pandemic.  We also have felt the increase in starting wages which has caused significant compression with staff that has been in jobs for longer periods of time.  Staff has been stressed and feeling burned out due to the different spikes in COVID cases. \n \nSupply change is a continued issue with shortages, delays and large price increases. Many of the strategies that were implemented in CY20 continued into CY1, such as visitor restrictions, masks and screening of patients.\n \nF",

    "Covid": "Fiscal/Calendar year 2023:\nWe continue to allow remote workers for our PFS/HIM/Acctg and other support staff.  We have some shortages with nursing, lab and ambulance workers.  We are using some travling staff mainly in Medical Surgical floor, and emergency room.  We hired two lab Techs from the Phillipines in prior years and hired an additional staff member from the Philipines in 2023 to address the lab tech shortage.  Supply chain continues to an issue with delays and price increases.  \nAs a critical access hospital, we need to transfer patients with more serious illness to other larger acute hospitals. The availability of beds for sicker patients and for mental health patients is a bigger issue than before as surrounding hospitals struggle with staffing and have closed specific services such as mental health.  Patients are experiencing delays in care because we can't transfer them to the appropriate setting. With some closures and staffing issues in other regional hospitals we are seeing an influx of patients to our emergency room and quick care setting as they face long waits in other communities.  This increase in volumes along with staff in issues have but more stress on our hospital and its resources than COVID.\n \n \n \nFiscal/Calendar year 2022:\n \n Many of the same challenges experienced in 2020 and 2021 continued in 2022.  We continue to allow remote workers.  Staffing shortages were felt in many departments as people did not come back to work or didn't want to work because of the pandemic. We have had to utilized contracted traveling nurses in several of our departments such as Medical Surgical floors, Emergency room and also in Lab as there is a shortage of Lab Techs.  We also have felt the increase in starting wages due to state mandate, this has caused significant compression with staff that has been in jobs for longer periods of time. It also has decreased staff for some of our entry level positions as they can make more in different industires.   Staff has been stressed and feeling burned out due to the different spikes in COVID cases. As a critical access hospital, we need to transfer patients with more serious illness to other larger acute hospitals. The availability of beds for sicker patients and for mental health patients continues to be an issue with patients experiencing delays in care because we can't transfer them to the appropriate setting. \n \nSupply change is a continued issue with shortages, delays and large price increases. Many of the strategies that were implemented in CY20 and CY 21 continued into CY, such as visitor restrictions, masks and screening of patients. On the positive side, we are experiencing higher volumes in our ancillary departments due to wait times and access issues at larger facilities. \n \n \n \n \n Calendar year 2020:\nThe State of Illinois mandated a stop to all elective surgeries and all non-essential services on 3/20/20 we stopped elective surgeries closed several of the departments such as Physical Occupational and Speech Therapy, Pulmonary Function testing, Sleep Lab and our gym. We only provided emergency, imaging and lab testing. Our three rural health clinics started providing telehealth services and cancelled wellness visits and few patients were seen in the clinics. We did not and do not have a specific telehealth platform, so providers were making telephone calls and began implementing Zoom visits.  \nWe closed our Active gym and all therapy related exercise programs such as SAIL, MedFit and Cardiac Phase 3 Rehab. The Cafe was closed to outside visitors and only served limited meals to staff. All of these closures decreased our revenue which has not totally recovered.\n \nOn 5/6/2020, some services were allowed but volumes were not what were budgeted and  Illinois was shut down again in November restricting some of the services. During the subsequent shut downs, elective surgeries were performed but all of the exercise programs and the cafe were closed again. \n \nWe experienced a shortage of PPE and other cleaning and necessary supplies during the course of the year.  Some of the items needed to operate are on still on an allocation based on Oct, Nov. and Dec. 2019 usage of the supply.  So we have had issues obtaining surgical drapes and supplies due to those volumes.  We have seen substantial increases in PPE and necessary supplies.  For instance glove prices have increased 300%.  We have also seen delays in obtaining supplies which has caused us to try and stock pile necessary items when we can get them which then lead to a shortage of storage space. \n \n \nIn order to have beds for potential COVID inpatients swing bed & inpatient services were restricted  We have issues transferring higher acuity patients to other hospitals so must limit some capacity to allow for those patients. We had to plan for the worst possible scenario regarding COVID patient surges.  We limited visitors in the ED and inpatient rooms which caused issues with patient families and stress on our nursing staff.  \n \n \nWe have added screening desk staff to asses patients before entry into the building and continue through 2021 to have this extra staff.  \n \nWe have had expenses to allow staff to work remotely if possible.  Throughout the months of the pandemic we have not furloughed or reduced staff hourly rates. We did not cut any benefits and continue to fund their retirement matching. We have experienced some morale issues with staff working with the COVID patients with staff experiencing burnout and isolation and fear. \n \nWhile the Federal Government through the stimulus package provided funding.  The continuing changing rules have caused more stress on the Finance staff to understand the rules, try and calculate incremental costs and costs paid by other sources that we find it will be difficult to support keeping the funds even though we have had extra costs and lost revenue.  \n \nDuring 2021:\nMany of the same challenges experienced in 2020 continued in 2021.  We continue to allow remote workers.  Additional challenges experienced were coverage due to staff illness or members of the family.  The continued fluctuation of the school and day care openings caused challenges for staff to find care for their children which let to staffing issues. Staffing shortages were felt in many departments as people did not come back to work or didn't want to work because of the pandemic.  We also have felt the increase in starting wages which has caused significant compression with staff that has been in jobs for longer periods of time.  Staff has been stressed and feeling burned out due to the different spikes in COVID cases. \n \nSupply change is a continued issue with shortages, delays and large price increases. Many of the strategies that were implemented in CY20 continued into CY1, such as visitor restrictions, masks and screening of patients.\n \nF",
