We have contracted with the below vendors to comply with these requirements:\n\nHVAC: GT Mechanical/ Dynamic \nFire Protection: Pro-fast\nElectrical: The Moore Group\nRoofing: Kedmont\nPainting: MJB Decorating\nDoors & Hardware: AndersonLock\nElectrical – Low Voltage: CVADA\nMetal Panels/Shades: Tueshall\nGrade Level Pavers: CR Schmidt\nGrand Stair: Skyline Ornamental \nFlooring: American Floor Company\nMasonry: All Masonry\nDrywall: All Masonry\nEpoxy Floorings: CCI Flooring\nGrand Level Landscaping: Great Lakes Landscaping",
    "plan_for_diversity_recruitment": "To effectively promote supplier and contractor diversity in upcoming planned capital expenditures, HPH will implement a multifaceted approach that involves communication, outreach, and collaboration. \nInternal Communication:\nInternal communication within the hospital is crucial to ensure that all relevant departments and stakeholders are aware of the initiative to promote supplier and contractor diversity. Efforts to increase organizational awareness of this initiative will involve memos, emails, presentations to key personnel, including HPH’s Materials Management team, departmental leadership, and the HPH executive team.\nExternal Outreach:\nHPH’s Material Management team will keep track of known diverse suppliers and contractors to inform them of upcoming capital expenditure opportunities. This will involve maintaining an on-going vendor database that allows us to search for vendors that are MWV owned. Given that our Materials Management team serves as the gatekeeper for capital expenditures, this team will always review potential MWE vendors in HPH’s vendor database to determine if there are any MWV vendors that may potentially meet the needs of the requested capital expenditure. \nHPH will begin to put processes in place to utilize existing networks and partnerships with diversity organizations, minority business enterprises (MBEs), and women business enterprises (WBEs) to reach out to a broader pool of potential suppliers and contractors. This also entails attending industry events, conferences, and networking opportunities focused on diversity and inclusion to connect with new suppliers and contractors.\nPromotion through Various Channels:\nHPH will leverage its website and social media channels to publicly announce their commitment to supplier and contractor diversity and highlight upcoming opportunities.\nHPH’s Materials Management and Marketing teams will work together to issue press releases and articles in local newspapers and industry publications to raise awareness within the community and among relevant stakeholders. This also entails including information about the initiative in relevant procurement documents, such as bid notices and requests for proposals (RFPs), to ensure that potential suppliers and contractors are aware of HPH’s commitment to diversity.\nTraining and Resources:\nHPH will provide training and resources to its Materials Management staff responsible for the procurement process as well as all operational stakeholders involved in the vendor decision-making process. The goal of the training will be to ensure that they understand the importance of diversity and inclusion and are equipped to evaluate and select diverse suppliers and contractors fairly and objectively.\nMeasurement and Reporting:\nHPH will establish metrics and benchmarks to track progress in promoting supplier and contractor diversity and regularly report on these metrics to internal and external stakeholders.\nAs HPH improves its processes to increase supplier diversity, we will celebrate successes and share best practices to inspire ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion throughout HPH and the broader community.\nFeedback Mechanism:\nHPH will establish a feedback mechanism to solicit input from diverse suppliers and contractors on their experiences working with HPH and identify opportunities for improvement.\nHPH will use this feedback to continuously refine and enhance the hospital's approach to promoting supplier and contractor diversity.\nBy implementing such a comprehensive plan, HPH can effectively alert and encourage its internal stakeholders and external enterprises of its efforts to promote supplier and contractor diversity in upcoming planned capital expenditures, fostering a more inclusive and equitable procurement process.",

    "point_of_contact": "I. A vendor interested in partnering with Humboldt Park Health (HPH) should contact the Vice President of Professional Services, Diego Lopez, at Dilopez@hph.care. The Vice President of Professional Services will collaborate with the Materials Management team to conduct a value analysis assessment of the vendor and the services offered. A decision to proceed will be made based on organizational need, in alignment with HPH's commitment to increasing its percentage of Minority, Women, and Veteran (MWV) vendors.",
    "enrollment_process": "To enroll with HPH as a recognized vendor/supplier of diversity ownership, we have established a comprehensive process designed to ensure transparency, fairness, and alignment with our commitment to diversity and inclusion. Here is a step-by-step guide to help vendors/suppliers navigate the enrollment process:\nStep 1: Preliminary Requirements\n• Business Certification: Vendors/suppliers must first obtain certification as a diverse business. This can be from recognized certifying bodies such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC), Women's Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC), National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC), or similar organizations for veteran-owned, disability-owned businesses.\n• Information Gathering: Prepare detailed information about your business, including services or products offered, company history, and any previous work with similar organizations.\nStep 2: Registration Process\n• Registration: Contact our Vice President of Professional Services, Diego Lopez at Dilopez@HPH.care or HPH’s Materials Management team. The vendor will then be designated as a MWV vendor in HPH’s database. \n• Documentation Submission: HPH’s Material’s Management team will upload the MWV vendor’s required documents, which typically include a diversity certification, business license, insurance information, and any other relevant certifications or qualifications that highlight the vendors credibility. \nStep 3: Assessment and Verification\n• Initial Review: Our Materials Management team will review the vendors submission to ensure completeness and compliance with our requirements.\n• Verification: HPH may reach out to the vendor for additional information or clarification. In some cases, further verification of the vendors diversity certification and business credentials may be necessary.\nStep 4: Approval and Onboarding\n• Approval Notification: Once the vendors application and diversity status are verified, they will receive a notification regarding approval and inclusion in our list of diverse vendors/suppliers.\n• Contract: Our Materials Management team and the respective operational leader utilizing the vendors services will assist with guiding the vendor through the contracting and onboarding process, which may include training and introduction to key personnel. \nStep 5: Continuous Engagement\n• Business Opportunities: As a recognized vendor/supplier of diversity ownership, they will receive notifications about relevant business opportunities and Requests for Proposals (RFPs).\n• Performance Evaluation: We are committed to building strong, mutually beneficial relationships with our diverse vendors/suppliers. Regular performance evaluations and feedback sessions will be conducted to ensure ongoing satisfaction and to identify areas for growth and development.\nSupport and Resources:\nHPH is dedicated to supporting diverse vendors/suppliers throughout their journey with us. Should they need assistance during the verification or contracting process, HPH’s Materials Management team is available to provide guidance and resources.\nHPH is committed to fostering successful MWV partnerships that contributes to our mutual growth and the broader goals of diversity and inclusion in the business community.",

    "Planned Diversity Expenditures": "At this time, Humboldt Park Health (HPH) is in the process of implementing an MWV program to identify and promote MWV vendor participation. \n\nFor our Wellness Center project, we are complying with the terms of the grant require the inclusion of minority owned enterprises as well as women owned enterprises to participate as vendors. We have contracted with the below vendors to comply with these requirements:\n\nHVAC: GT Mechanical/ Dynamic \nFire Protection: Pro-fast\nElectrical: The Moore Group\nRoofing: Kedmont\nPainting: MJB Decorating\nDoors & Hardware: AndersonLock\nElectrical – Low Voltage: CVADA\nMetal Panels/Shades: Tueshall\nGrade Level Pavers: CR Schmidt\nGrand Stair: Skyline Ornamental \nFlooring: American Floor Company\nMasonry: All Masonry\nDrywall: All Masonry\nEpoxy Floorings: CCI Flooring\nGrand Level Landscaping: Great Lakes Landscaping",
    "Plan for Diversity Recruitment": "To effectively promote supplier and contractor diversity in upcoming planned capital expenditures, HPH will implement a multifaceted approach that involves communication, outreach, and collaboration. \nInternal Communication:\nInternal communication within the hospital is crucial to ensure that all relevant departments and stakeholders are aware of the initiative to promote supplier and contractor diversity. Efforts to increase organizational awareness of this initiative will involve memos, emails, presentations to key personnel, including HPH’s Materials Management team, departmental leadership, and the HPH executive team.\nExternal Outreach:\nHPH’s Material Management team will keep track of known diverse suppliers and contractors to inform them of upcoming capital expenditure opportunities. This will involve maintaining an on-going vendor database that allows us to search for vendors that are MWV owned. Given that our Materials Management team serves as the gatekeeper for capital expenditures, this team will always review potential MWE vendors in HPH’s vendor database to determine if there are any MWV vendors that may potentially meet the needs of the requested capital expenditure. \nHPH will begin to put processes in place to utilize existing networks and partnerships with diversity organizations, minority business enterprises (MBEs), and women business enterprises (WBEs) to reach out to a broader pool of potential suppliers and contractors. This also entails attending industry events, conferences, and networking opportunities focused on diversity and inclusion to connect with new suppliers and contractors.\nPromotion through Various Channels:\nHPH will leverage its website and social media channels to publicly announce their commitment to supplier and contractor diversity and highlight upcoming opportunities.\nHPH’s Materials Management and Marketing teams will work together to issue press releases and articles in local newspapers and industry publications to raise awareness within the community and among relevant stakeholders. This also entails including information about the initiative in relevant procurement documents, such as bid notices and requests for proposals (RFPs), to ensure that potential suppliers and contractors are aware of HPH’s commitment to diversity.\nTraining and Resources:\nHPH will provide training and resources to its Materials Management staff responsible for the procurement process as well as all operational stakeholders involved in the vendor decision-making process. The goal of the training will be to ensure that they understand the importance of diversity and inclusion and are equipped to evaluate and select diverse suppliers and contractors fairly and objectively.\nMeasurement and Reporting:\nHPH will establish metrics and benchmarks to track progress in promoting supplier and contractor diversity and regularly report on these metrics to internal and external stakeholders.\nAs HPH improves its processes to increase supplier diversity, we will celebrate successes and share best practices to inspire ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion throughout HPH and the broader community.\nFeedback Mechanism:\nHPH will establish a feedback mechanism to solicit input from diverse suppliers and contractors on their experiences working with HPH and identify opportunities for improvement.\nHPH will use this feedback to continuously refine and enhance the hospital's approach to promoting supplier and contractor diversity.\nBy implementing such a comprehensive plan, HPH can effectively alert and encourage its internal stakeholders and external enterprises of its efforts to promote supplier and contractor diversity in upcoming planned capital expenditures, fostering a more inclusive and equitable procurement process.",
    "Challenges to Diversity Recruitment": "Model just started so we do not have any experience to report at this time.",
    "HSFRB Assistance": "We have only limited resources to build an infrastructure to support this program.",
    "Certifications": "At this time, HPH does not hold or recognize any certifications related to the recruitment of diversely-owned vendors/supplies. HPH will work on implementing processes to recognize applicable certifications in this area in CY24.",
    "Point of Contact": "I. A vendor interested in partnering with Humboldt Park Health (HPH) should contact the Vice President of Professional Services, Diego Lopez, at Dilopez@hph.care. The Vice President of Professional Services will collaborate with the Materials Management team to conduct a value analysis assessment of the vendor and the services offered. A decision to proceed will be made based on organizational need, in alignment with HPH's commitment to increasing its percentage of Minority, Women, and Veteran (MWV) vendors.",
    "Enrollment Process": "To enroll with HPH as a recognized vendor/supplier of diversity ownership, we have established a comprehensive process designed to ensure transparency, fairness, and alignment with our commitment to diversity and inclusion. Here is a step-by-step guide to help vendors/suppliers navigate the enrollment process:\nStep 1: Preliminary Requirements\n• Business Certification: Vendors/suppliers must first obtain certification as a diverse business. This can be from recognized certifying bodies such as the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC), Women's Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC), National Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC), or similar organizations for veteran-owned, disability-owned businesses.\n• Information Gathering: Prepare detailed information about your business, including services or products offered, company history, and any previous work with similar organizations.\nStep 2: Registration Process\n• Registration: Contact our Vice President of Professional Services, Diego Lopez at Dilopez@HPH.care or HPH’s Materials Management team. The vendor will then be designated as a MWV vendor in HPH’s database. \n• Documentation Submission: HPH’s Material’s Management team will upload the MWV vendor’s required documents, which typically include a diversity certification, business license, insurance information, and any other relevant certifications or qualifications that highlight the vendors credibility. \nStep 3: Assessment and Verification\n• Initial Review: Our Materials Management team will review the vendors submission to ensure completeness and compliance with our requirements.\n• Verification: HPH may reach out to the vendor for additional information or clarification. In some cases, further verification of the vendors diversity certification and business credentials may be necessary.\nStep 4: Approval and Onboarding\n• Approval Notification: Once the vendors application and diversity status are verified, they will receive a notification regarding approval and inclusion in our list of diverse vendors/suppliers.\n• Contract: Our Materials Management team and the respective operational leader utilizing the vendors services will assist with guiding the vendor through the contracting and onboarding process, which may include training and introduction to key personnel. \nStep 5: Continuous Engagement\n• Business Opportunities: As a recognized vendor/supplier of diversity ownership, they will receive notifications about relevant business opportunities and Requests for Proposals (RFPs).\n• Performance Evaluation: We are committed to building strong, mutually beneficial relationships with our diverse vendors/suppliers. Regular performance evaluations and feedback sessions will be conducted to ensure ongoing satisfaction and to identify areas for growth and development.\nSupport and Resources:\nHPH is dedicated to supporting diverse vendors/suppliers throughout their journey with us. Should they need assistance during the verification or contracting process, HPH’s Materials Management team is available to provide guidance and resources.\nHPH is committed to fostering successful MWV partnerships that contributes to our mutual growth and the broader goals of diversity and inclusion in the business community.",
