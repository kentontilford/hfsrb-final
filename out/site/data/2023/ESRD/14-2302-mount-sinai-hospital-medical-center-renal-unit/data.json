    "covid": "The COVID-19 pandemic still negatively impacted the ESRD facility in 2022. Transportation issues persisted throughout the year, especially when patients tested positive for COVID-19 but were asymptomatic, or transportation services were experiencing staffing shortages which resulted in increased patient wait times or missed treatment, since no other transportation service was available to the patient. The clinic experienced staffing shortages which caused a delay in admitting patients to the unit since there were no applicants for technicians or nurses and resulted in the unit manager to be in staffing mode. As a clinic, staffed picked up extra hours to cover staffing holes, as well as partnering with the inpatient dialysis unit of the health system to help fill open shifts as well, so that safe patient was maintained. Supply levels were able to be consistently maintained throughout the year but as a health system, we did have our acid and bicarb allocation reduced to 80% from 100% for three inpatient units and the ESRD facility. We were able to work out a plan to ensure that no patient care would be delayed or impacted due to supplies not being available by sharing supplies or ensuring that supplies were ordered appropriately with plenty of time to receive them. \n\nThe unit continued to maintain and follow COVID-19 screening, testing, and treatment clinical guidelines of the American Society of Nephrology. Patients received education on how to practice good hand hygiene and help reduce the spread of infections like COVID-19 and the flu by washing hands, not touching their face, being shown how to properly wear a face mask and when to get a new one, and to notify staff if they are not feeling well in order to reduce the spread of infection and to ensure that they would still be able to receive their full treatment if transportation became an issue. \n\nThe unit also moved to a new physical location on the hospital campus. Staff was trained on the new location, updated water rooms and machines, and what to do in case of an emergency. Patients were oriented to new unit and shown what to do in case of an emergency.",
